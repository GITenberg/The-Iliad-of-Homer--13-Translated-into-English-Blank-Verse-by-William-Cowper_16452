<h2 class="chap">PREFACE.</h2>

<p>Whether a translation of <span class="smcap">Homer</span> may be best executed in blank verse or
in rhyme, is a question in the decision of which no man can find difficulty,
who has ever duly considered what translation ought to be, or who is in any
degree practically acquainted with those very different kinds of versification.
I will venture to assert that a just translation of any ancient poet in rhyme,
is impossible. No human ingenuity can be equal to the task of closing
every couplet with sounds homotonous, expressing at the same time the
full sense, and only the full sense of his original. The translator's ingenuity,
indeed, in this case becomes itself a snare, and the readier he is at invention
and expedient, the more likely he is to be betrayed into the widest departures
from the guide whom he professes to follow. Hence it has happened,
that although the public have long been in possession of an English <span class="smcap">Homer</span>
by a poet whose writings have done immortal honor to his country, the
demand of a new one, and especially in blank verse, has been repeatedly
and loudly made by some of the best judges and ablest writers of the present
day.</p>

<p>I have no contest with my predecessor. None is supposable between
performers on different instruments. Mr. Pope has surmounted all difficulties
in his version of <span class="smcap">Homer</span> that it was possible to surmount in rhyme.
But he was fettered, and his fetters were his choice. Accustomed always
to rhyme, he had formed to himself an ear which probably could not be
much gratified by verse that wanted it, and determined to encounter even
impossibilities, rather than abandon a mode of writing in which he had
excelled every body, for the sake of another to which, unexercised in it as
he was, he must have felt strong objections.</p>

<p>I number myself among the warmest admirers of Mr. Pope as an original
writer, and I allow him all the merit he can justly claim as the translator of
this chief of poets. He has given us the <i>Tale of Troy divine</i> in smooth
verse, generally in correct and elegant language, and in diction often highly
poetical. But his deviations are so many, occasioned chiefly by the cause
already mentioned, that, much as he has done, and valuable as his work is
on some accounts, it was yet in the humble province of a translator that I
thought it possible even for me to fellow him with some advantage.</p>

<p>That he has sometimes altogether suppressed the sense of his author, and
has not seldom intermingled his own ideas with it, is a remark which, on
<span class="pgnm">viii</span><a name="page_viii" id="page_viii"></a>
this occasion, nothing but necessity should have extorted from me. But
we differ sometimes so widely in our matter, that unless this remark, invidious
as it seems, be premised, I know not how to obviate a suspicion, on
the one hand, of careless oversight, or of factitious embellishment on the
other. On this head, therefore, the English reader is to be admonished,
that the matter found in me, whether he like it or not, is found also in <span class="smcap">Homer</span>,
and that the matter not found in me, how much soever he may admire
it, is found only in Mr. Pope. I have omitted nothing; I have invented
nothing.</p>

<p>There is indisputably a wide difference between the case of an original
writer in rhyme and a translator. In an original work the author is free;
if the rhyme be of difficult attainment, and he cannot find it in one direction,
he is at liberty to seek it in another; the matter that will not accommodate
itself to his occasions he may discard, adopting such as will. But
in a translation no such option is allowable; the sense of the author is required,
and we do not surrender it willingly even to the plea of necessity.
Fidelity is indeed of the very essence of translation, and the term itself implies
it. For which reason, if we suppress the sense of our original, and
force into its place our own, we may call our work an <i>imitation</i>, if we
please, or perhaps a <i>paraphrase</i>, but it is no longer the same author only in
a different dress, and therefore it is not translation. Should a painter, professing
to draw the likeness of a beautiful woman, give her more or fewer
features than belong to her, and a general cast of countenance of his own
invention, he might be said to have produced a <i>jeu d'esprit</i>, a curiosity perhaps
in its way, but by no means the lady in question.</p>

<p>It will however be necessary to speak a little more largely to this subject,
on which discordant opinions prevail even among good judges.</p>

<p>The free and the close translation have, each, their advocates. But inconveniences
belong to both. The former can hardly be true to the original
author's style and manner, and the latter is apt to be servile. The one loses
his peculiarities, and the other his spirit. Were it possible, therefore, to
find an exact medium, a manner so close that it should let slip nothing of
the text, nor mingle any thing extraneous with it, and at the same time so
free as to have an air of originality, this seems precisely the mode in which
an author might be best rendered. I can assure my readers from my own
experience, that to discover this very delicate line is difficult, and to proceed
by it when found, through the whole length of a poet voluminous as <span class="smcap">Homer</span>,
nearly impossible. I can only pretend to have endeavored it.</p>

<p>It is an opinion commonly received, but, like many others, indebted for
its prevalence to mere want of examination, that a translator should imagine
to himself the style which his author would probably have used, had
the language into which he is rendered been his own. A direction which
wants nothing but practicability to recommend it. For suppose six persons,
equally qualified for the task, employed to translate the same Ancient
into their own language, with this rule to guide them. In the event it
would be found, that each had fallen on a manner different from that of all
the rest, and by probable inference it would follow that none had fallen on
the right. On the whole, therefore, as has been said, the translation which
partakes equally of fidelity and liberality, that is close, but not so close as to
<span class="pgnm">ix</span><a name="page_ix" id="page_ix"></a>
be servile, free, but not so free as to be licentious, promises fairest; and my
ambition will be sufficiently gratified, if such of my readers as are able, and
will take the pains to compare me in this respect with <span class="smcap">Homer</span>, shall judge
that I have in any measure attained a point so difficult.</p>

<p>As to energy and harmony, two grand requisites in a translation of this
most energetic and most harmonious of all poets, it is neither my purpose nor
my wish, should I be found deficient in either, or in both, to shelter myself
under an unfilial imputation of blame to my mother-tongue. Our language
is indeed less musical than the Greek, and there is no language with which
I am at all acquainted that is not. But it is musical enough for the purposes
of melodious verse, and if it seem to fail, on whatsoever occasion, in energy,
the blame is due, not to itself, but to the unskilful manager of it. For so
long as Milton's works, whether his prose or his verse, shall exist, so long
there will be abundant proof that no subject, however important, however
sublime, can demand greater force of expression than is within the compass
of the English language.</p>

<p>I have no fear of judges familiar with original <span class="smcap">Homer</span>. They need not be
told that a translation of him is an arduous enterprise, and as such, entitled
to some favor. From these, therefore, I shall expect, and shall not be disappointed,
considerable candor and allowance. Especially <i>they</i> will be candid,
and I believe that there are many such, who have occasionally tried their
own strength in this <i>bow of Ulysses</i>. They have not found it supple and pliable,
and with me are perhaps ready to acknowledge that they could not
always even approach with it the mark of their ambition. But I would willingly,
were it possible, obviate uncandid criticism, because to answer it is
lost labor, and to receive it in silence has the appearance of stately reserve,
and self-importance.</p>

<p>To those, therefore, who shall be inclined to tell me hereafter that my diction
is often plain and unelevated, I reply beforehand that I know it,&mdash;that
it would be absurd were it otherwise, and that Homer himself stands in the
same predicament. In fact, it is one of his numberless excellences, and a
point in which his judgment never fails him, that he is grand and lofty always
in the right place, and knows infallibly how to rise and fall with his
subject. <i>Big words on small matters</i> may serve as a pretty exact definition
of the burlesque; an instance of which they will find in the Battle of the
Frogs and Mice, but none in the Iliad.</p>

<p>By others I expect to be told that my numbers, though here and there tolerably
smooth, are not always such, but have, now and then, an ugly hitch
in their gait, ungraceful in itself, and inconvenient to the reader. To this
charge also I plead guilty, but beg leave in alleviation of judgment to add,
that my limping lines are not numerous, compared with those that limp not.
The truth is, that not one of them all escaped me, but, such as they are, they
were all made such with a wilful intention. In poems of great length there
is no blemish more to be feared than sameness of numbers, and every art is
useful by which it may be avoided. A line, rough in itself, has yet its recommendations;
it saves the ear the pain of an irksome monotony, and
seems even to add greater smoothness to others. Milton, whose ear and
taste were exquisite, has exemplified in his Paradise Lost the effect of this
practice frequently.</p>

<p><span class="pgnm">x</span><a name="page_x" id="page_x"></a>
Having mentioned Milton, I cannot but add an observation on the similitude
of his manner to that of <span class="smcap">Homer</span>. It is such, that no person familiar
with both, can read either without being reminded of the other; and it is
in those breaks and pauses, to which the numbers of the English poet are
so much indebted both for their dignity and variety, that he chiefly copies
the Grecian. But these are graces to which rhyme is not competent; so
broken, it loses all its music; of which any person may convince himself by
reading a page only of any of our poets anterior to Denham, Waller, and
Dryden. A translator of <span class="smcap">Homer</span>, therefore, seems directed by <span class="smcap">Homer</span> himself
to the use of blank verse, as to that alone in which he can be rendered
with any tolerable representation of his manner in this particular. A
remark which I am naturally led to make by a desire to conciliate, if possible,
some, who, rather unreasonably partial to rhyme, demand it on all
occasions, and seem persuaded that poetry in our language is a vain attempt
without it. Verse, that claims to be verse in right of its metre only, they
judge to be such rather by courtesy than by kind, on an apprehension that
it costs the writer little trouble, that he has only to give his lines their
prescribed number of syllables, and so far as the mechanical part is concerned,
all is well. Were this true, they would have reason on their side;
for the author is certainly best entitled to applause who succeeds against
the greatest difficulty, and in verse that calls for the most artificial management
in its construction. But the case is not as they suppose. To rhyme,
in our language, demands no great exertion of ingenuity, but is always easy
to a person exercised in the practice. Witness the multitudes who rhyme,
but have no other poetical pretensions. Let it be considered too, how merciful
we are apt to be to unclassical and indifferent language for the sake
of rhyme, and we shall soon see that the labor lies principally on the other
side. Many ornaments of no easy purchase are required to atone for the
absence of this single recommendation. It is not sufficient that the lines
of blank verse be smooth in themselves, they must also be harmonious in
the combination. Whereas the chief concern of the rhymist is to beware
that his couplets and his sense be commensurate, lest the regularity of his
numbers should be (too frequently at least) interrupted. A trivial difficulty
this, compared with those which attend the poet unaccompanied by his
bells. He, in order that he may be musical, must exhibit all the variations,
as he proceeds, of which ten syllables are susceptible; between the first
syllable and the last there is no place at which he must not occasionally
pause, and the place of the pause must be perpetually shifted. To effect
this variety, his attention must be given, at one and the same time, to the
pauses he has already made in the period before him, as well as to that
which he is about to make, and to those which shall succeed it. On no
lighter terms than these is it possible that blank verse can be written which
will not, in the course of a long work, fatigue the ear past all endurance.
If it be easier, therefore, to throw five balls into the air and to catch them in
succession, than to sport in that manner with one only, then may blank
verse be more easily fabricated than rhyme. And if to these labors we add
others equally requisite, a style in general more elaborate than rhyme requires,
farther removed from the vernacular idiom both in the language
<span class="pgnm">xi</span><a name="page_xi" id="page_xi"></a>
itself and in the arrangement of it, we shall not long doubt which of these
two very different species of verse threatens the composer with most
expense of study and contrivance. I feel it unpleasant to appeal to my own
experience, but, having no other voucher at hand, am constrained to it. As
I affirm, so I have found. I have dealt pretty largely in both kinds, and
have frequently written more verses in a day, with tags, than I could ever
write without them. To what has been here said (which whether it have
been said by others or not, I cannot tell, having never read any modern book
on the subject) I shall only add, that to be poetical without rhyme, is an
argument of a sound and classical constitution in any language.</p>

<p>A word or two on the subject of the following translation, and I have
done.</p>

<p>My chief boast is that I have adhered closely to my original, convinced
that every departure from him would be punished with the forfeiture of
some grace or beauty for which I could substitute no equivalent. The
epithets that would consent to an English form I have preserved as
epithets; others that would not, I have melted into the context. There are
none, I believe, which I have not translated in one way or other, though the
reader will not find them repeated so often as most of them are in <span class="smcap">Homer</span>,
for a reason that need not be mentioned.</p>

<p>Few persons of any consideration are introduced either in the Iliad or
Odyssey by their own name only, but their patronymic is given also. To
this ceremonial I have generally attended, because it is a circumstance of
my author's manner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Homer</span> never allots less than a whole line to the introduction of a
speaker. No, not even when the speech itself is no longer than the line
that leads it. A practice to which, since he never departs from it, he must
have been determined by some cogent reason. He probably deemed it a
formality necessary to the majesty of his narration. In this article, therefore,
I have scrupulously adhered to my pattern, considering these introductory
lines as heralds in a procession; important persons, because employed
to usher in persons more important than themselves.</p>

<p>It has been my point every where to be as little verbose as possible,
though; at the same time, my constant determination not to sacrifice my
author's full meaning to an affected brevity.</p>

<p>In the affair of style, I have endeavored neither to creep nor to bluster,
for no author is so likely to betray his translator into both these faults, as
<span class="smcap">Homer</span>, though himself never guilty of either. I have cautiously avoided
all terms of new invention, with an abundance of which, persons of more
ingenuity than judgment have not enriched our language, but incumbered
it. I have also every where used an unabbreviated fullness of phrase as
most suited to the nature of the work, and, above all, have studied perspicuity,
not only because verse is good for little that wants it, but because
<span class="smcap">Homer</span> is the most perspicuous of all poets.</p>

<p>In all difficult places I have consulted the best commentators, and where
they have differed, or have given, as is often the case, a variety of solutions,
I have ever exercised my best judgment, and selected that which appears,
at least to myself, the most probable interpretation. On this ground,
<span class="pgnm">xii</span><a name="page_xii" id="page_xii"></a>
and on account of the fidelity which I have already boasted, I may venture,
I believe, to recommend my work as promising some usefulness to young
students of the original.</p>

<p>The passages which will be least noticed, and possibly not at all, except
by those who shall wish to find me at a fault, are those which have cost me
abundantly the most labor. It is difficult to kill a sheep with dignity in a
modern language, to flay and to prepare it for the table, detailing every circumstance
of the process. Difficult also, without sinking below the level
of poetry, to harness mules to a wagon, particularizing every article of their
furniture, straps, rings, staples, and even the tying of the knots that kept all
together. <span class="smcap">Homer</span>, who writes always to the eye, with all his sublimity and
grandeur, has the minuteness of a Flemish painter.</p>

<p>But in what degree I have succeeded in my version either of these passages,
and such as these, or of others more buoyant and above-ground, and
especially of the most sublime, is now submitted to the decision of the
reader, to whom I am ready enough to confess that I have not at all consulted
their approbation, who account nothing grand that is not turgid, or elegant
that is not bedizened with metaphor.</p>

<p>I purposely decline all declamation on the merits of <span class="smcap">Homer</span>, because a
translator's praises of his author are liable to a suspicion of dotage, and because
it were impossible to improve on those which this author has received
already. He has been the wonder of all countries that his works have ever
reached, even deified by the greatest names of antiquity, and in some places
actually worshipped. And to say truth, were it possible that mere man
could entitle himself by pre-eminence of any kind to divine honors, Homer's
astonishing powers seem to have given him the best pretensions.</p>

<p>I cannot conclude without due acknowledgments to the best critic in
<span class="smcap">Homer</span> I have ever met with, the learned and ingenious Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuseli</span>. Unknown
as he was to me when I entered on this arduous undertaking (indeed
to this moment I have never seen him) he yet voluntarily and generously
offered himself as my revisor. To his classical taste and just discernment
I have been indebted for the discovery of many blemishes in my own work,
and of beauties, which would otherwise have escaped me, in the original.
But his necessary avocations would not suffer him to accompany me farther
than to the latter books of the Iliad, a circumstance which I fear my readers,
as well as myself, will regret with too much reason.<a class="ftnt" href="#Pref1_1">[1]</a></p>

<p>I have obligations likewise to many friends, whose names, were it proper
to mention them here, would do me great honor. They have encouraged me
by their approbation, have assisted me with valuable books, and have eased
me of almost the whole labor of transcribing.</p>

<p>And now I have only to regret that my pleasant work is ended. To the
illustrious Greek I owe the smooth and easy flight of many thousand hours.
He has been my companion at home and abroad, in the study, in the garden,
and in the field; and no measure of success, let my labors succeed as they
may, will ever compensate to me the loss of the innocent luxury that I have
enjoyed, as a translator of <span class="smcap">Homer</span>.</p>

<p class="ctr">PREPARED BY MR. COWPER,<br />
<span style="font-size: smaller">FOR A</span><br />
<b>SECOND EDITION.</b></p>

<p>Soon after my publication of this work, I began to prepare it for a second
edition, by an accurate revisal of the first. It seemed to me, that here and
there, perhaps a slight alteration might satisfy the demands of some, whom
I was desirous to please; and I comforted myself with the reflection, that
if I still failed to conciliate all, I should yet have no cause to account myself
in a singular degree unfortunate. To please an unqualified judge, an author
must sacrifice too much; and the attempt to please an uncandid one were
altogether hopeless. In one or other of these classes may be ranged all such
objectors, as would deprive blank verse of one of its principal advantages,
the variety of its pauses; together with all such as deny the good effect, on
the whole, of a line, now and then, less harmonious than its fellows.</p>

<p>With respect to the pauses, it has been affirmed with an unaccountable
rashness, that <span class="smcap">Homer</span> himself has given me an example of verse without
them. Had this been true, it would by no means have concluded against
the use of them in an English version of <span class="smcap">Homer</span>; because, in one language,
and in one species of metre, that may be musical, which in another would
be found disgusting. But the assertion is totally unfounded. The pauses
in Homer's verse are so frequent and various, that to name another poet, if
pauses are a fault, more faulty than he, were, perhaps, impossible. It may
even be questioned, if a single passage of ten lines flowing with uninterrupted
smoothness could be singled out from all the thousands that he has
left us. He frequently pauses at the first word of the line, when it consists
of three or more syllables; not seldom when of two; and sometimes even
when of one only. In this practice he was followed, as was observed in my
Preface to the first edition, by the Author of the Paradise Lost. An example
inimitable indeed, but which no writer of English heroic verse without
rhyme can neglect with impunity.</p>

<p>Similar to this is the objection which proscribes absolutely the occasional
use of a line irregularly constructed. When Horace censured Lucilius for
his lines <i>incomposite pede currentes</i>, he did not mean to say, that he was
<span class="pgnm">xiv</span><a name="page_xiv" id="page_xiv"></a>
chargeable with such in some instances, or even in many, for then the censure
would have been equally applicable to himself; but he designed by that
expression to characterize all his writings. The censure therefore was just;
Lucilius wrote at a time when the Roman verse had not yet received its
polish, and instead of introducing artfully his rugged lines, and to serve a
particular purpose, had probably seldom, and never but by accident, composed
a smooth one. Such has been the versification of the earliest
poets in every country. Children lisp, at first, and stammer; but, in time,
their speech becomes fluent, and, if they are well taught, harmonious.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Homer</span> himself is not invariably regular in the construction of his verse.
Had he been so, Eustathius, an excellent critic and warm admirer of <span class="smcap">Homer</span>,
had never affirmed, that some of his lines want a head, some a tail,
and others a middle. Some begin with a word that is neither dactyl nor
spondee, some conclude with a dactyl, and in the intermediate part he
sometimes deviates equally from the established custom. I confess that
instances of this sort are rare; but they are surely, though few, sufficient to
warrant a sparing use of similar license in the present day.</p>

<p>Unwilling, however, to seem obstinate in both these particulars, I conformed
myself in some measure to these objections, though unconvinced
myself of their propriety. Several of the rudest and most unshapely lines I
composed anew; and several of the pauses least in use I displaced for the
sake of an easier enunciation.&mdash;And this was the state of the work after the
revisal given it about seven years since.</p>

<p>Between that revisal and the present a considerable time intervened, and
the effect of long discontinuance was, that I became more dissatisfied with
it myself, than the most difficult to be pleased of all my judges. Not for the
sake of a few uneven lines or unwonted pauses, but for reasons far more
substantial. The diction seemed to me in many passages either not sufficiently
elevated, or deficient in the grace of ease, and in others I found the
sense of the original either not adequately expressed or misapprehended.
Many elisions still remained unsoftened; the compound epithets I found
not always happily combined, and the same sometimes too frequently repeated.</p>

<p>There is no end of passages in <span class="smcap">Homer</span>, which must creep unless they are
lifted; yet in such, all embellishment is out of the question. The hero puts
on his clothes, or refreshes himself with food and wine, or he yokes his
steed, takes a journey, and in the evening preparation is made for his
repose. To give relief to subjects prosaic as these without seeming unreasonably
tumid is extremely difficult. Mr. Pope much abridges some of
them, and others he omits; but neither of these liberties was compatible
with the nature of my undertaking. These, therefore, and many similar to
these, have been new-modeled; somewhat to their advantage I hope, but
not even now entirely to my satisfaction. The lines have a more natural
movement, the pauses are fewer and less stately, the expression as easy as
I could make it without meanness, and these were all the improvements
that I could give them.</p>

<p>The elisions, I believe, are all cured, with only one exception. An alternative
proposes itself to a modern versifier, from which there is no escape,
<span class="pgnm">xv</span><a name="page_xv" id="page_xv"></a>
which occurs perpetually, and which, choose as he may, presents him
always with an evil. I mean in the instance of the particle (<i>the</i>). When
this particle precedes a vowel, shall he melt it into the substantive, or leave
the <i>hiatus</i> open? Both practices are offensive to a delicate ear. The particle
absorbed occasions harshness, and the open vowel a vacuity equally
inconvenient. Sometimes, therefore, to leave it open, and sometimes to
ingraft it into its adjunct seems most advisable; this course Mr. Pope has
taken, whose authority recommended it to me; though of the two evils I
have most frequently chosen the elision as the least.</p>

<p>Compound epithets have obtained so long in the poetical language of our
country, that I employed them without fear or scruple. To have abstained
from them in a blank verse translation of Homer, who abounds with them,
and from whom our poets probably first adopted them, would have been
strange indeed. But though the genius of our language favors the formation
of such words almost as much as that of the Greek, it happens sometimes,
that a Grecian compound either cannot be rendered in English at all,
or, at best, but awkwardly. For this reason, and because I found that
some readers much disliked them, I have expunged many; retaining, according
to my best judgment, the most eligible only, and making less frequent
the repetitions even of these.</p>

<p>I know not that I can add any thing material on the subject of this last
revisal, unless it be proper to give the reason why the Iliad, though greatly
altered, has undergone much fewer alterations than the Odyssey. The true
reason I believe is this. The Iliad demanded my utmost possible exertions;
it seemed to meet me like an ascent almost perpendicular, which could not
be surmounted at less cost than of all the labor that I could bestow on it.
The Odyssey on the contrary seemed to resemble an open and level country,
through which I might travel at my ease. The latter, therefore, betrayed
me into some negligence, which, though little conscious of it at the time,
on an accurate search, I found had left many disagreeable effects behind it.</p>

<p>I now leave the work to its fate. Another may labor hereafter in an
attempt of the same kind with more success; but more industriously, I believe,
none ever will.</p>

<h2 class="chap">PREFACE</h2>
<p class="ctr"><span style="font-size: smaller">BY</span><br />
J. JOHNSON, LL.B.<br />
<span style="font-size: smaller">CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.</span></p>

<p>I have no other pretensions to the honorable name of Editor on this occasion,
than as a faithful transcriber of the Manuscript, and a diligent corrector
of the Press, which are, doubtless, two of the very humblest employments
in that most extensive province. I have wanted the ability to attempt
any thing higher; and, fortunately for the reader, I have also wanted the
presumption. What, however, I can do, I will. Instead of critical remark,
I will furnish him with anecdote. He shall trace from beginning to end the
progress of the following work; and in proportion as I have the happiness
to engage his attention, I shall merit the name of a fortunate editor.</p>

<p>It was in the darkest season of a most calamitous depression of his spirits,
that I was summoned to the house of my inestimable friend the Translator,
in the month of January, 1794. He had happily completed a revisal of his
<span class="smcap">Homer</span>, and was thinking of the preface to his new edition, when all his
satisfaction in the one, and whatever he had projected for the other, in a
moment vanished from his mind. He had fallen into a deplorable illness;
and though the foremost wish of my heart was to lessen the intenseness of
his misery, I was utterly unable to afford him any aid.</p>

<p>I had, however, a pleasing though a melancholy opportunity of tracing his
recent footsteps in the Field of Troy, and in the Palace of Ithaca. He had
materially altered both the Iliad and Odyssey; and, so far as my ability
allowed me to judge, they were each of them greatly improved. He had
also, at the request of his bookseller, interspersed the two poems with copious
notes; for the most part translations of the ancient Scholia, and gleaned,
at the cost of many valuable hours, from the pages of Barnes, Clarke, and
Villoisson. It has been a constant subject of regret to the admirers of "The
Task," that the exercise of such marvelous original powers, should have
been so long suspended by the drudgery of translation; and in this view,
their quarrel with the illustrious Greek will be, doubtless, extended to his
commentators.<a class="ftnt" href="#Pref3_1">[1]</a></p>

<p><span class="pgnm">xviii</span><a name="page_xviii" id="page_xviii"></a>
During two long years from this most anxious period, the translation
continued as it was; and though, in the hope of its being able to divert his
melancholy, I had attempted more than once to introduce it to its Author, I
was every time painfully obliged to desist. But in the summer of ninety-six,
when he had resided with me in Norfolk twelve miserable months, the introduction
long wished for took place. To my inexpressible astonishment
and joy, I surprised him, one morning, with the Iliad in his hand; and with
an excess of delight, which I am still more unable to describe, I the next day
discovered that he had been writing.&mdash;Were I to mention one of the happiest
moments of my life, it might be that which introduced me to the following
lines:&mdash;</p>

<p>He had written these lines with a pencil, on a leaf at the end of his Iliad;
and when I reflected on the cause which had given them birth, I could not
but admire its disproportion to the effect. What the voice of persuasion had
failed in for a year, accident had silently accomplished in a single day. The
circumstance I allude to was this: I received a copy of the Iliad and Odyssey
of Pope, then recently published by the Editor above mentioned, with
illustrative and critical notes of his own. As it commended Mr. Cowper's
Translation in the Preface, and occasionally pointed out its merits in the
Notes, I was careful to place it in his way; though it was more from a habit
of experiment which I had contracted, than from well-grounded hopes of
success. But what a fortunate circumstance was the arrival of this Work!
and by what name worthy of its influence shall I call it? In the mouth of
<span class="pgnm">xix</span><a name="page_xix" id="page_xix"></a>
an indifferent person it might be Chance; but in mine; whom it rendered so
peculiarly happy, common gratitude requires that it should be Providence.</p>

<p>As I watched him with an indescribable interest in his progress, I had the
satisfaction to find, that, after a few mornings given to promiscuous correction,
and to frequent perusal of the above-mentioned Notes, he was evidently
settling on the sixteenth Book. This he went regularly through, and the
fruits of an application so happily resumed were, one day with another, about
sixty new lines. But with the end of the sixteenth Book he had closed the
corrections of the year. An excursion to the coast, which immediately
followed, though it promised an accession of strength to the body, could not
fail to interfere with the pursuits of the mind. It was therefore with much
less surprise than regret, that I saw him relinquish the "<i>Tale of Troy Divine</i>."</p>

<p>Such was the prelude to the last revisal, which, in the month of January,
ninety-seven, Mr. Cowper was persuaded to undertake; and to a
faithful copy, as I trust, of which, I have at this time the honor to conduct
the reader. But it may not be amiss to observe, that with regard to the
earlier books of the Iliad, it was less a revisal of the altered text, than of the
text as it stands in the first edition. For though the interleaved copy was
always at hand, and in the multitude of its altered places could hardly fail to
offer some things worthy to be preserved, but which the ravages of illness
and the lapse of time might have utterly effaced from his mind, I could not
often persuade the Translator to consult it. I was therefore induced, in the
course of transcribing, to compare the two revisals as I went along, and to
plead for the continuance of the first correction, when it forcibly struck me
as better than the last. This, however, but seldom occurred; and the
practice, at length, was completely left off, by his consenting to receive into
the number of the books which were daily laid open before him, the interleaved
copy to which I allude.</p>

<p>At the end of the first six books of the Iliad, the arrival of spring brought
the usual interruptions of exercise and air, which increased as the summer
advanced to a degree so unfavorable to the progress of <span class="smcap">Homer</span>, that in the
requisite attention to their salutary claims, the revisal was, at one time,
altogether at a stand. Only four books were added in the course of nine
months; but opportunity returning as the winter set in, there were added,
in less than seven weeks, four more: and thus ended the year ninety-seven.</p>

<p>As the spring that succeeded was a happier spring, so it led to a happier
summer. We had no longer air and exercise alone, but exercise and Homer
hand in hand. He even followed us thrice to the sea: and whether
our walks were</p>

<div class="poem">
<p style="text-indent: 7em;">"on the margin of the land,<br />
O'er the green summit of the" cliffs, "whose base<br />
Beats back the roaring surge,"</p>
<p style="text-indent: 8em;">"or on the shore<br />
Of the untillable and barren deep,"</p>
</div>

<p style="text-indent: 0;">they were always within hearing of his magic song. About the middle of
this busy summer, the revisal of the Iliad was brought to a close; and on
the very next day, the 24th of July, the correction of the Odyssey commenced,&mdash;a
<span class="pgnm">xx</span><a name="page_xx" id="page_xx"></a>
morning rendered memorable by a kind and unexpected visit
from the patroness of that work, the Dowager Lady Spencer!</p>

<p>It is not my intention to detain the reader with a progressive account of
the Odyssey revised, as circumstantial as that of the Iliad, because it went
on smoothly from beginning to end, and was finished in less than eight
months.</p>

<p>I cannot deliver these volumes to the public without feeling emotions of
gratitude toward Heaven, in recollecting how often this corrected Work
has appeared to me an instrument of Divine mercy, to mitigate the sufferings
of my excellent relation. Its progress in our private hours was singularly
medicinal to his mind: may its presentment to the Public prove not
less conducive to the honor of the departed Author, who has every claim to
my veneration! As a copious life of the Poet is already in the press, from
the pen of his intimate friend Mr. Hayley, it is unnecessary for me to enter
on such extensive commendation of his character, as my own intimacy
with him might suggest; but I hope the reader will kindly allow me the
privilege of indulging, in some degree, the feelings of my heart, by applying
to him, in the close of this Preface, an expressive verse (borrowed from
Homer) which he inscribed himself, with some little variation, on a bust of
his Grecian Favorite.</p>

all the notes without signatures are Mr. Cowper's, and that those marked B.C.V. are
respectively found in the editions of Homer by Barnes, Clarke, and Villoisson. But
the employment was so little to the taste and inclination of the poet, that he never afterward

<h2 class="chap">ADVERTISEMENT TO SOUTHEY'S EDITION</h2>

<p>It is incumbent upon the present Editor to state the reasons which have
induced him, between two editions of Cowper's <span class="smcap">Homer</span>, differing so materially
from each other that they might almost be deemed different versions,
to prefer the first.</p>

<p>Whoever has perused the Translator's letters, must have perceived that
he had considered with no ordinary care the scheme of his versification,
and that when he resolved upon altering it in a second edition, it was in
deference to the opinion of others.</p>

<p>It seems to the Editor that Cowper's own judgment is entitled to more
respect, than that of any, or all his critics; and that the version which he
composed when his faculties were most active and his spirits least subject
to depression,&mdash;indeed in the happiest part of his life,&mdash;ought not to be
superseded by a revisal, or rather reconstruction, which was undertaken
three years before his death,&mdash;not like the first translation as "a pleasant
work, an innocent luxury," the cheerful and delightful occupation of hope
and ardor and ambition,&mdash;but as a "hopeless employment," a task to which
he gave "all his miserable days, and often many hours of the night," seeking
to beguile the sense of utter wretchedness, by altering as if for the sake
of alteration.</p>

<p>The Editor has been confirmed in this opinion by the concurrence of every
person with whom he has communicated on the subject. Among others
he takes the liberty of mentioning Mr. Cary, whose authority upon such a
question is of especial weight, the Translator of Dante being the only one
of our countrymen who has ever executed a translation of equal magnitude
and not less difficulty, with the same perfect fidelity and admirable skill.</p>

<p>In support of this determination, the case of Tasso may be cited as curiously
in point. The great Italian poet altered his Jerusalem like Cowper,
against his own judgment, in submission to his critics: he made the alteration
in the latter years of his life, and in a diseased state of mind; and he
proceeded upon the same prescribed rule of smoothing down his versification,
and removing all the elisions. The consequence has been that the
reconstructed poem is utterly neglected, and has rarely, if ever, been reprinted,
except in the two great editions of his collected works; while the original
poem has been and continues to be in such demand, that the most diligent
bibliographer might vainly attempt to enumerate all the editions
through which it has passed.</p>

<hr class="large" />
<div><span class="pgnm">xxiii</span><a name="page_xxiii" id="page_xxiii"></a></div>

<h2 class="chap">EDITOR'S NOTE.</h2>

<p>It will be seen by the Advertisement to Southey's edition of Cowper's
Translation of the Iliad, that he has the highest opinion of its merits, and
that he also gives the preference to Cowper's unrevised edition. The Editor
of the present edition is happy to offer it to the public under the sanction
of such high authority.</p>

<p>In the addition of notes I have availed myself of the learning of various
commentators (Pope, Coleridge, M&uuml;ller, etc.) and covet no higher praise
than the approval of my judgment in the selection.</p>

<p>Those bearing the signature E.P.P., were furnished by my friend Miss
Peabody, of Boston. I would also acknowledge my obligations to C.C.
Felton, Eliot Professor of Greek in Harvard University. It should be observed,
that the remarks upon the language of the poem refer to it in the
original.</p>

<p>For a definite treatment of the character of each deity introduced in the
Iliad, and for the fable of the Judgment of Paris, which was the primary
cause of the Trojan war, the reader is referred to "Grecian and Roman
Mythology."</p>

<p>It is intended that this edition of the Iliad shall be followed by a similar
one of the Odyssey, provided sufficient encouragement is given by the demand
for the present volume.</p>

<h3 class="chap">ARGUMENT OF THE FIRST BOOK.</h3>

<p class="outd">The book opens with an account of a pestilence that prevailed in the Grecian
camp, and the cause of it is assigned. A council is called, in which
fierce altercation takes place between Agamemnon and Achilles. The
latter solemnly renounces the field. Agamemnon, by his heralds, demands
Bris&euml;is, and Achilles resigns her. He makes his complaint to
Thetis, who undertakes to plead his cause with Jupiter. She pleads it,
and prevails. The book concludes with an account of what passed in
Heaven on that occasion.</p>

<p>[The reader will please observe, that by Achaians, Argives, Dana&iuml;, are
signified Grecians. Homer himself having found these various appellatives
both graceful and convenient, it seemed unreasonable that a Translator of
him should be denied the same advantage.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Tr</span>.]</p>

His daughter, and his hands charged with the wreath<br />
And golden sceptre<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_1-2">[2]</a> of the God shaft-arm'd.</p>
<p>His supplication was at large to all<br />
The host of Greece, but most of all to two,<span class="lnm">20</span><br />
The sons of Atreus, highest in command.</p>
<p>Ye gallant Chiefs, and ye their gallant host,<br />
(So may the Gods who in Olympus dwell<br />
Give Priam's treasures to you for a spoil<br />
And ye return in safety,) take my gifts<span class="lnm">25</span><br />
And loose my child, in honor of the son<br />
Of Jove, Apollo, archer of the skies.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_1-3">[3]</a></p>
<p>At once the voice of all was to respect<br />
The priest, and to accept the bounteous price;<br />
But so it pleased not Atreus' mighty son,<span class="lnm">30</span><br />
Who with rude threatenings stern him thence dismiss'd.</p>
<p>Beware, old man! that at these hollow barks<br />
I find thee not now lingering, or henceforth<br />
Returning, lest the garland of thy God<br />
<span class="pgnm">005</span><a name="page_005" id="page_005"></a>
And his bright sceptre should avail thee nought.<span class="lnm">35</span><br />
I will not loose thy daughter, till old age<br />
Steal on her. From her native country far,<br />
In Argos, in my palace, she shall ply<br />
The loom, and shall be partner of my bed.<br />
Move me no more. Begone; hence while thou may'st.<span class="lnm">40</span></p>
<p>He spake, the old priest trembled and obey'd.<br />
Forlorn he roamed the ocean's sounding shore,<br />
And, solitary, with much prayer his King<br />
Bright-hair'd Latona's son, Ph&oelig;bus, implored.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_1-4">[4]</a></p>
<p>God of the silver bow, who with thy power<span class="lnm">45</span><br />
Encirclest Chrysa, and who reign'st supreme<br />
In Tenedos and Cilla the divine,<br />
Sminthian<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_1-5">[5]</a> Apollo!<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_1-6">[6]</a> If I e'er adorned<br />
Thy beauteous fane, or on the altar burn'd<br />
The fat acceptable of bulls or goats,<span class="lnm">50</span><br />
Grant my petition. With thy shafts avenge<br />
On the Achaian host thy servant's tears.</p>
<p>Such prayer he made, and it was heard.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_1-7">[7]</a> The God,<br />
Down from Olympus with his radiant bow<br />
<span class="pgnm">006</span><a name="page_006" id="page_006"></a>
And his full quiver o'er his shoulder slung,<span class="lnm">55</span><br />
Marched in his anger; shaken as he moved<br />
His rattling arrows told of his approach.<br />
Gloomy he came as night; sat from the ships<br />
Apart, and sent an arrow. Clang'd the cord<br />
<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_1-8">[8]</a>Dread-sounding, bounding on the silver bow.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_1-9">[9]</a><span class="lnm">60</span><br />
Mules first and dogs he struck,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_1-10">[10]</a> but at themselves<br />
Dispatching soon his bitter arrows keen,<br />
Smote them. Death-piles on all sides always blazed.<br />
Nine days throughout the camp his arrows flew;<br />
The tenth, Achilles from all parts convened<span class="lnm">65</span><br />
The host in council. Juno the white-armed<br />
Moved at the sight of Grecians all around<br />
Dying, imparted to his mind the thought.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_1-11">[11]</a><br />
The full assembly, therefore, now convened,<br />
Uprose Achilles ardent, and began.<span class="lnm">70</span></p>
<p><span class="pgnm">007</span><a name="page_007" id="page_007"></a>
Atrides! Now, it seems, no course remains<br />
For us, but that the seas roaming again,<br />
We hence return; at least if we survive;<br />
But haste, consult we quick some prophet here<br />
Or priest, or even interpreter of dreams,<span class="lnm">75</span><br />
(For dreams are also of Jove,) that we may learn<br />
By what crime we have thus incensed Apollo,<br />
What broken vow, what hecatomb unpaid<br />
He charges on us, and if soothed with steam<br />
Of lambs or goats unblemish'd, he may yet<span class="lnm">80</span><br />
Be won to spare us, and avert the plague.</p>
<p>He spake and sat, when Thestor's son arose<br />
Calchas, an augur foremost in his art,<br />
Who all things, present, past, and future knew,<br />
And whom his skill in prophecy, a gift<span class="lnm">85</span><br />
Conferred by Ph&oelig;bus on him, had advanced<br />
To be conductor of the fleet to Troy;<br />
He, prudent, them admonishing, replied.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_1-12">[12]</a></p>
<p>Jove-loved Achilles! Wouldst thou learn from me<br />
What cause hath moved Apollo to this wrath,<span class="lnm">90</span><br />
The shaft-arm'd King? I shall divulge the cause.<br />
But thou, swear first and covenant on thy part<br />
That speaking, acting, thou wilt stand prepared<br />
To give me succor; for I judge amiss,<br />
Or he who rules the Argives, the supreme<span class="lnm">95</span><br />
O'er all Achaia's host, will be incensed.<br />
Wo to the man who shall provoke the King<br />
For if, to-day, he smother close his wrath,<br />
He harbors still the vengeance, and in time<br />
Performs it. Answer, therefore, wilt thou save me?<span class="lnm">100</span></p>
<p>To whom Achilles, swiftest of the swift.<br />
What thou hast learn'd in secret from the God<br />
That speak, and boldly. By the son of Jove,<br />
Apollo, whom thou, Calchas, seek'st in prayer<br />
<span class="pgnm">008</span><a name="page_008" id="page_008"></a>
Made for the Dana&iuml;, and who thy soul<span class="lnm">105</span><br />
Fills with futurity, in all the host<br />
The Grecian lives not, who while I shall breathe,<br />
And see the light of day, shall in this camp<br />
Oppress thee; no, not even if thou name<br />
Him, Agamemnon, sovereign o'er us all.<span class="lnm">110</span></p>
<p>Then was the seer embolden'd, and he spake.<br />
Nor vow nor hecatomb unpaid on us<br />
He charges, but the wrong done to his priest<br />
Whom Agamemnon slighted when he sought<br />
His daughter's freedom, and his gifts refused.<span class="lnm">115</span><br />
He is the cause. Apollo for his sake<br />
Afflicts and will afflict us, neither end<br />
Nor intermission of his heavy scourge<br />
Granting, 'till unredeem'd, no price required,<br />
The black-eyed maid be to her father sent,<span class="lnm">120</span><br />
And a whole hecatomb in Chrysa bleed.<br />
Then, not before, the God may be appeased.</p>
<p>He spake and sat; when Atreus' son arose,<br />
The Hero Agamemnon, throned supreme.<br />
Tempests of black resentment overcharged<span class="lnm">125</span><br />
His heart, and indignation fired his eyes.<br />
On Calchas lowering, him he first address'd.</p>
<p>Prophet of mischief! from whose tongue no note<br />
Of grateful sound to me, was ever heard;<br />
Ill tidings are thy joy, and tidings glad<span class="lnm">130</span><br />
Thou tell'st not, or thy words come not to pass.<br />
And now among the Dana&iuml; thy dreams<br />
Divulging, thou pretend'st the Archer-God<br />
For his priest's sake, our enemy, because<br />
I scorn'd his offer'd ransom of the maid<span class="lnm">135</span><br />
Chrys&euml;is, more desirous far to bear<br />
Her to my home, for that she charms me more<br />
Than Clytemnestra, my own first espoused,<br />
With whom, in disposition, feature, form,<br />
Accomplishments, she may be well compared.<span class="lnm">140</span><br />
Yet, being such, I will return her hence<br />
If that she go be best. Perish myself&mdash;<br />
<span class="pgnm">009</span><a name="page_009" id="page_009"></a>
But let the people of my charge be saved<br />
Prepare ye, therefore, a reward for me,<br />
And seek it instant. It were much unmeet<span class="lnm">145</span><br />
That I alone of all the Argive host<br />
Should want due recompense, whose former prize<br />
Is elsewhere destined, as ye all perceive.</p>
<p>To whom Achilles, matchless in the race.<br />
Atrides, glorious above all in rank,<span class="lnm">150</span><br />
And as intent on gain as thou art great,<br />
Whence shall the Grecians give a prize to thee?<br />
The general stock is poor; the spoil of towns<br />
Which we have taken, hath already passed<br />
In distribution, and it were unjust<span class="lnm">155</span><br />
To gather it from all the Greeks again.<br />
But send thou back this Virgin to her God,<br />
And when Jove's favor shall have given us Troy,<br />
A threefold, fourfold share shall then be thine.</p>
<p>To whom the Sovereign of the host replied.<span class="lnm">160</span><br />
Godlike Achilles, valiant as thou art,<br />
Wouldst thou be subtle too? But me no fraud<br />
Shall overreach, or art persuade, of thine.<br />
Wouldst thou, that thou be recompensed, and I<br />
Sit meekly down, defrauded of my due?<span class="lnm">165</span><br />
And didst thou bid me yield her? Let the bold<br />
Achaians give me competent amends,<br />
Such as may please me, and it shall be well.<br />
Else, if they give me none, I will command<br />
Thy prize, the prize of Ajax, or the prize<span class="lnm">170</span><br />
It may be of Ulysses to my tent,<br />
And let the loser chafe. But this concern<br />
Shall be adjusted at convenient time.<br />
Come&mdash;launch we now into the sacred deep<br />
A bark with lusty rowers well supplied;<span class="lnm">175</span><br />
Then put on board Chrys&euml;is, and with her<br />
The sacrifice required. Go also one<br />
High in authority, some counsellor,<br />
Idomeneus, or Ajax, or thyself,<br />
Thou most untractable of all mankind;<span class="lnm">180</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">010</span><a name="page_010" id="page_010"></a>
And seek by rites of sacrifice and prayer<br />
To appease Apollo on our host's behalf.</p>
<p>Achilles eyed him with a frown, and spake.<br />
Ah! clothed with impudence as with a cloak,<br />
And full of subtlety, who, thinkest thou&mdash;<span class="lnm">185</span><br />
What Grecian here will serve thee, or for thee<br />
Wage covert war, or open? Me thou know'st,<br />
Troy never wronged; I came not to avenge<br />
Harm done to me; no Trojan ever drove<br />
My pastures, steeds or oxen took of mine,<span class="lnm">190</span><br />
Or plunder'd of their fruits the golden fields<br />
Of Phthia<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_1-13">[13]</a> the deep-soil'd. She lies remote,<br />
And obstacles are numerous interposed,<br />
Vale-darkening mountains, and the dashing sea.<br />
No, <a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_1-14">[14]</a>Shameless Wolf! For thy good pleasure's sake<span class="lnm">195</span><br />
We came, and, <a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_1-15">[15]</a>Face of flint! to avenge the wrongs<br />
By Menelaus and thyself sustain'd,<br />
On the offending Trojan&mdash;service kind,<br />
But lost on thee, regardless of it all.<br />
And now&mdash;What now? Thy threatening is to seize<span class="lnm">200</span><br />
Thyself, the just requital of my toils,<br />
My prize hard-earn'd, by common suffrage mine.<br />
I never gain, what Trojan town soe'er<br />
We ransack, half thy booty. The swift march<br />
And furious onset&mdash;these I largely reap,<span class="lnm">205</span><br />
But, distribution made, thy lot exceeds<br />
Mine far; while I, with any pittance pleased,<br />
Bear to my ships the little that I win<br />
After long battle, and account it much.<br />
But I am gone, I and my sable barks<span class="lnm">210</span><br />
(My wiser course) to Phthia, and I judge,<br />
<span class="pgnm">011</span><a name="page_011" id="page_011"></a>
Scorn'd as I am, that thou shalt hardly glean<br />
Without me, more than thou shalt soon consume.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_1-16">[16]</a></p>
<p>He ceased, and Agamemnon thus replied<br />
Fly, and fly now; if in thy soul thou feel<span class="lnm">215</span><br />
Such ardor of desire to go&mdash;begone!<br />
I woo thee not to stay; stay not an hour<br />
On my behalf, for I have others here<br />
Who will respect me more, and above all<br />
All-judging Jove. There is not in the host<span class="lnm">220</span><br />
King or commander whom I hate as thee,<br />
For all thy pleasure is in strife and blood,<br />
And at all times; yet valor is no ground<br />
Whereon to boast, it is the gift of Heaven<br />
Go, get ye back to Phthia, thou and thine!<span class="lnm">225</span><br />
There rule thy Myrmidons.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_1-17">[17]</a> I need not thee,<br />
Nor heed thy wrath a jot. But this I say,<br />
Sure as Apollo takes my lovely prize<br />
Chrys&euml;is, and I shall return her home<br />
In mine own bark, and with my proper crew,<span class="lnm">230</span><br />
So sure the fair Bris&euml;is shall be mine.<br />
I shall demand her even at thy tent.<br />
So shalt thou well be taught, how high in power<br />
I soar above thy pitch, and none shall dare<br />
Attempt, thenceforth, comparison with me.<span class="lnm">235</span></p>
<p>He ended, and the big, disdainful heart<br />
Throbbed of Achilles; racking doubt ensued<br />
And sore perplex'd him, whether forcing wide<br />
A passage through them, with his blade unsheathed<br />
To lay Atrides breathless at his foot,<span class="lnm">240</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">012</span><a name="page_012" id="page_012"></a>
Or to command his stormy spirit down.<br />
So doubted he, and undecided yet<br />
Stood drawing forth his falchion huge; when lo!<br />
Down sent by Juno, to whom both alike<br />
Were dear, and who alike watched over both,<span class="lnm">245</span><br />
Pallas descended. At his back she stood<br />
To none apparent, save himself alone,<br />
And seized his golden locks. Startled, he turned,<br />
And instant knew Minerva. Flashed her eyes<br />
Terrific;<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_1-18">[18]</a> whom with accents on the wing<span class="lnm">250</span><br />
Of haste, incontinent he questioned thus.</p>
<p>Daughter of Jove, why comest thou? that thyself<br />
May'st witness these affronts which I endure<br />
From Agamemnon? Surely as I speak,<br />
This moment, for his arrogance, he dies.<span class="lnm">255</span></p>
<p>To whom the blue-eyed Deity. From heaven<br />
Mine errand is, to sooth, if thou wilt hear,<br />
Thine anger. Juno the white-arm'd alike<br />
To him and thee propitious, bade me down:<br />
Restrain thy wrath. Draw not thy falchion forth.<span class="lnm">260</span><br />
Retort, and sharply, and let that suffice.<br />
For I foretell thee true. Thou shalt receive,<br />
Some future day, thrice told, thy present loss<br />
For this day's wrong. Cease, therefore, and be still.</p>
<p>To whom Achilles. Goddess, although much<span class="lnm">265</span><br />
Exasperate, I dare not disregard<br />
Thy word, which to obey is always best.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_1-19">[19]</a><br />
Who hears the Gods, the Gods hear also him.</p>
<p>He said; and on his silver hilt the force<br />
Of his broad hand impressing, sent the blade<span class="lnm">270</span><br />
Home to its rest, nor would the counsel scorn<br />
<span class="pgnm">013</span><a name="page_013" id="page_013"></a>
Of Pallas. She to heaven well-pleased return'd,<br />
And in the mansion of Jove &AElig;gis<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_1-20">[20]</a>-armed<br />
Arriving, mingled with her kindred Gods.<br />
But though from violence, yet not from words<span class="lnm">275</span><br />
Abstained Achilles, but with bitter taunt<br />
Opprobrious, his antagonist reproached.</p>
<p>Oh charged with wine, in steadfastness of face<br />
Dog unabashed, and yet at heart a deer!<br />
Thou never, when the troops have taken arms,<span class="lnm">280</span><br />
Hast dared to take thine also; never thou<br />
Associate with Achaia's Chiefs, to form<br />
The secret ambush.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_1-21">[21]</a> No. The sound of war<br />
Is as the voice of destiny to thee.<br />
Doubtless the course is safer far, to range<span class="lnm">285</span><br />
Our numerous host, and if a man have dared<br />
Dispute thy will, to rob him of his prize.<br />
King! over whom? Women and spiritless&mdash;<br />
Whom therefore thou devourest; else themselves<br />
Would stop that mouth that it should scoff no more.<span class="lnm">290</span><br />
But hearken. I shall swear a solemn oath.<br />
By this same sceptre,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_1-22">[22]</a> which shall never bud,<br />
Nor boughs bring forth as once, which having left<br />
Its stock on the high mountains, at what time<br />
The woodman's axe lopped off its foliage green,<span class="lnm">295</span><br />
And stript its bark, shall never grow again;<br />
Which now the judges of Achaia bear,<br />
<span class="pgnm">014</span><a name="page_014" id="page_014"></a>
Who under Jove, stand guardians of the laws,<br />
By this I swear (mark thou the sacred oath)<br />
Time shall be, when Achilles shall be missed;<span class="lnm">300</span><br />
When all shall want him, and thyself the power<br />
To help the Achaians, whatsoe'er thy will;<br />
When Hector at your heels shall mow you down:<br />
The Hero-slaughtering Hector! Then thy soul,<br />
Vexation-stung, shall tear thee with remorse,<span class="lnm">305</span><br />
That thou hast scorn'd, as he were nothing worth,<br />
A Chief, the soul and bulwark of your cause.</p>
<p>So saying, he cast his sceptre on the ground<br />
Studded with gold, and sat. On the other side<br />
The son of Atreus all impassion'd stood,<span class="lnm">310</span><br />
When the harmonious orator arose<br />
Nestor, the Pylian oracle, whose lips<br />
Dropped eloquence&mdash;the honey not so sweet.<br />
Two generations past of mortals born<br />
In Pylus, co&euml;taneous with himself,<span class="lnm">315</span><br />
He govern'd now the third&mdash;amid them all<br />
He stood, and thus, benevolent, began.</p>
<p>Ah! what calamity hath fall'n on Greece!<br />
Now Priam and his sons may well exult,<br />
Now all in Ilium shall have joy of heart<span class="lnm">320</span><br />
Abundant, hearing of this broil, the prime<br />
Of Greece between, in council and in arms.<br />
But be persuaded; ye are younger both<br />
Than I, and I was conversant of old<br />
With Princes your superiors, yet from them<span class="lnm">325</span><br />
No disrespect at any time received.<br />
Their equals saw I never; never shall;<br />
Exadius, C&oelig;neus, and the Godlike son<br />
Of &AElig;geus, mighty Theseus; men renown'd<br />
For force superior to the race of man,<span class="lnm">330</span><br />
Brave Chiefs they were, and with brave foes they fought,<br />
With the rude dwellers on the mountain-heights<br />
The Centaurs,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_1-23">[23]</a> whom with havoc such as fame<br />
<span class="pgnm">015</span><a name="page_015" id="page_015"></a>
Shall never cease to celebrate, they slew.<br />
With these men I consorted erst, what time<span class="lnm">335</span><br />
From Pylus, though a land from theirs remote,<br />
They called me forth, and such as was my strength,<br />
With all that strength I served them. Who is he?<br />
What Prince or Chief of the degenerate race<br />
Now seen on earth who might with these compare?<span class="lnm">340</span><br />
Yet even these would listen and conform<br />
To my advice in consultation given,<br />
Which hear ye also; for compliance proves<br />
Oft times the safer and the manlier course.<br />
Thou, Agamemnon! valiant as thou art,<span class="lnm">345</span><br />
Seize not the maid, his portion from the Greeks,<br />
But leave her his; nor thou, Achilles, strive<br />
With our imperial Chief; for never King<br />
Had equal honor at the hands of Jove<br />
With Agamemnon, or was throned so high.<span class="lnm">350</span><br />
Say thou art stronger, and art Goddess-born,<br />
How then? His territory passes thine,<br />
And he is Lord of thousands more than thou.<br />
Cease, therefore, Agamemnon; calm thy wrath;<br />
And it shall be mine office to entreat<span class="lnm">355</span><br />
Achilles also to a calm, whose might<br />
The chief munition is of all our host.</p>
<p>To whom the sovereign of the Greeks replied,<br />
The son of Atreus. Thou hast spoken well,<br />
Old Chief, and wisely. But this wrangler here&mdash;<span class="lnm">360</span><br />
Nought will suffice him but the highest place:<br />
He must control us all, reign over all,<br />
Dictate to all; but he shall find at least<br />
One here, disposed to question his commands.<br />
If the eternal Gods have made him brave,<span class="lnm">365</span><br />
Derives he thence a privilege to rail?</p>
<p>Whom thus Achilles interrupted fierce.<br />
Could I be found so abject as to take<br />
The measure of my doings at thy lips,<br />
Well might they call me coward through the camp,<span class="lnm">370</span><br />
A vassal, and a fellow of no worth.<br />
<span class="pgnm">016</span><a name="page_016" id="page_016"></a>
Give law to others. Think not to control<br />
Me, subject to thy proud commands no more.<br />
Hear yet again! And weigh what thou shalt hear.<br />
I will not strive with thee in such a cause,<span class="lnm">375</span><br />
Nor yet with any man; I scorn to fight<br />
For her, whom having given, ye take away.<br />
But I have other precious things on board;<br />
Of those take none away without my leave.<br />
Or if it please thee, put me to the proof<span class="lnm">380</span><br />
Before this whole assembly, and my spear<br />
Shall stream that moment, purpled with thy blood.</p>
<p>Thus they long time in opposition fierce<br />
Maintained the war of words; and now, at length,<br />
(The grand consult dissolved,) Achilles walked<span class="lnm">385</span><br />
(Patroclus and the Myrmidons his steps<br />
Attending) to his camp and to his fleet.<br />
But Agamemnon order'd forth a bark,<br />
A swift one, manned with twice ten lusty rowers;<br />
He sent on board the Hecatomb:<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_1-24">[24]</a> he placed<span class="lnm">390</span><br />
Chrys&euml;is with the blooming cheeks, himself,<br />
And to Ulysses gave the freight in charge.<br />
So all embarked, and plow'd their watery way.<br />
Atrides, next, bade purify the host;<br />
The host was purified, as he enjoin'd,<span class="lnm">395</span><br />
And the ablution cast into the sea.</p>
<p>Then to Apollo, on the shore they slew,<br />
Of the untillable and barren deep,<br />
Whole Hecatombs of bulls and goats, whose steam<br />
Slowly in smoky volumes climbed the skies.<span class="lnm">400</span></p>
<p>Thus was the camp employed; nor ceased the while<br />
The son of Atreus from his threats denounced<br />
At first against Achilles, but command<br />
Gave to Talthybius and Eurybates<br />
His heralds, ever faithful to his will.<span class="lnm">405</span></p>
<p>Haste&mdash;Seek ye both the tent of Peleus' son<br />
Achilles. Thence lead hither by the hand<br />
<span class="pgnm">017</span><a name="page_017" id="page_017"></a>
Blooming Bris&euml;is, whom if he withhold,<br />
Not her alone, but other spoil myself<br />
Will take in person&mdash;He shall rue the hour.<span class="lnm">410</span></p>
<p>With such harsh message charged he them dismissed<br />
They, sad and slow, beside the barren waste<br />
Of Ocean, to the galleys and the tents<br />
Moved of the Myrmidons. Him there they found<br />
Beneath the shadow of his bark reclined,<span class="lnm">415</span><br />
Nor glad at their approach. Trembling they stood,<br />
In presence of the royal Chief, awe-struck,<br />
Nor questioned him or spake. He not the less<br />
Knew well their embassy, and thus began.</p>
<p>Ye heralds, messengers of Gods and men,<span class="lnm">420</span><br />
Hail, and draw near! I bid you welcome both.<br />
I blame not you; the fault is his alone<br />
Who sends you to conduct the damsel hence<br />
Bris&euml;is. Go, Patroclus, generous friend!<br />
Lead forth, and to their guidance give the maid.<span class="lnm">425</span><br />
But be themselves my witnesses before<br />
The blessed Gods, before mankind, before<br />
The ruthless king, should want of me be felt<br />
To save the host from havoc<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_1-25">[25]</a>&mdash;Oh, his thoughts<br />
Are madness all; intelligence or skill,<span class="lnm">430</span><br />
Forecast or retrospect, how best the camp<br />
May be secured from inroad, none hath he.</p>
<p>He ended, nor Patroclus disobey'd,<br />
But leading beautiful Bris&euml;is forth<br />
Into their guidance gave her; loth she went<span class="lnm">435</span><br />
From whom she loved, and looking oft behind.<br />
Then wept Achilles, and apart from all,<br />
With eyes directed to the gloomy Deep<br />
And arms outstretch'd, his mother suppliant sought.</p>
<p>Since, mother, though ordain'd so soon to die,<span class="lnm">440</span><br />
I am thy son, I might with cause expect<br />
Some honor at the Thunderer's hands, but none<br />
To me he shows, whom Agamemnon, Chief<br />
<span class="pgnm">018</span><a name="page_018" id="page_018"></a>
Of the Achaians, hath himself disgraced,<br />
Seizing by violence my just reward.<span class="lnm">445</span></p>
<p>So prayed he weeping, whom his mother heard<br />
Within the gulfs of Ocean where she sat<br />
Beside her ancient sire. From the gray flood<br />
Ascending sudden, like a mist she came,<br />
Sat down before him, stroked his face, and said.<span class="lnm">450</span></p>
<p>Why weeps my son? and what is thy distress?<br />
Hide not a sorrow that I wish to share.</p>
<p>To whom Achilles, sighing deep, replied.<br />
Why tell thee woes to thee already known?<br />
At Thebes, E&euml;tion's city we arrived,<span class="lnm">455</span><br />
Smote, sack'd it, and brought all the spoil away.<br />
Just distribution made among the Greeks,<br />
The son of Atreus for his lot received<br />
Blooming Chrys&euml;is. Her, Apollo's priest<br />
Old Chryses followed to Achaia's camp,<span class="lnm">460</span><br />
That he might loose his daughter. Ransom rich<br />
He brought, and in his hands the hallow'd wreath<br />
And golden sceptre of the Archer God<br />
Apollo, bore; to the whole Grecian host,<br />
But chiefly to the foremost in command<span class="lnm">465</span><br />
He sued, the sons of Atreus; then, the rest<br />
All recommended reverence of the Seer,<br />
And prompt acceptance of his costly gifts.<br />
But Agamemnon might not so be pleased,<br />
Who gave him rude dismission; he in wrath<span class="lnm">470</span><br />
Returning, prayed, whose prayer Apollo heard,<br />
For much he loved him. A pestiferous shaft<br />
He instant shot into the Grecian host,<br />
And heap'd the people died. His arrows swept<br />
The whole wide camp of Greece, 'till at the last<span class="lnm">475</span><br />
A Seer, by Ph&oelig;bus taught, explain'd the cause.<br />
I first advised propitiation. Rage<br />
Fired Agamemnon. Rising, he denounced<br />
Vengeance, and hath fulfilled it. She, in truth,<br />
Is gone to Chrysa, and with her we send<span class="lnm">480</span><br />
Propitiation also to the King<br />
<span class="pgnm">019</span><a name="page_019" id="page_019"></a>
Shaft-arm'd Apollo. But my beauteous prize<br />
Bris&euml;is, mine by the award of all,<br />
His heralds, at this moment, lead away.<br />
But thou, wherein thou canst, aid thy own son!<span class="lnm">485</span><br />
Haste hence to Heaven, and if thy word or deed<br />
Hath ever gratified the heart of Jove,<br />
With earnest suit press him on my behalf.<br />
For I, not seldom, in my father's hall<br />
Have heard thee boasting, how when once the Gods,<span class="lnm">490</span><br />
With Juno, Neptune, Pallas at their head,<br />
Conspired to bind the Thunderer, thou didst loose<br />
His bands, O Goddess! calling to his aid<br />
The Hundred-handed warrior, by the Gods<br />
Briareus, but by men, &AElig;geon named.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_1-26">[26]</a><span class="lnm">495</span><br />
For he in prowess and in might surpassed<br />
<span class="pgnm">020</span><a name="page_020" id="page_020"></a>
His father Neptune, who, enthroned sublime,<br />
Sits second only to Saturnian Jove,<br />
Elate with glory and joy. Him all the Gods<br />
Fearing from that bold enterprise abstained.<span class="lnm">500</span><br />
Now, therefore, of these things reminding Jove,<br />
Embrace his knees; entreat him that he give<br />
The host of Troy his succor, and shut fast<br />
The routed Grecians, prisoners in the fleet,<br />
That all may find much solace<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_1-27">[27]</a> in their King,<span class="lnm">505</span><br />
And that the mighty sovereign o'er them all,<br />
Their Agamemnon, may himself be taught<br />
His rashness, who hath thus dishonor'd foul<br />
The life itself, and bulwark of his cause.</p>
<p>To him, with streaming eyes, Thetis replied.<span class="lnm">510</span><br />
Born as thou wast to sorrow, ah, my son!<br />
Why have I rear'd thee! Would that without tears,<br />
Or cause for tears (transient as is thy life,<br />
A little span) thy days might pass at Troy!<br />
But short and sorrowful the fates ordain<span class="lnm">515</span><br />
Thy life, peculiar trouble must be thine,<br />
Whom, therefore, oh that I had never borne!<br />
But seeking the Olympian hill snow-crown'd,<br />
I will myself plead for thee in the ear<br />
Of Jove, the Thunderer. Meantime at thy fleet<span class="lnm">520</span><br />
Abiding, let thy wrath against the Greeks<br />
Still burn, and altogether cease from war.<br />
For to the banks of the Oceanus,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_1-28">[28]</a><br />
Where &AElig;thiopia holds a feast to Jove,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_1-29">[29]</a><br />
<span class="pgnm">021</span><a name="page_021" id="page_021"></a>
He journey'd yesterday, with whom the Gods<span class="lnm">525</span><br />
Went also, and the twelfth day brings them home.<br />
Then will I to his brazen-floor'd abode,<br />
That I may clasp his knees, and much misdeem<br />
Of my endeavor, or my prayer shall speed.</p>
<p>So saying, she went; but him she left enraged<span class="lnm">530</span><br />
For fair Bris&euml;is' sake, forced from his arms<br />
By stress of power. Meantime Ulysses came<br />
To Chrysa with the Hecatomb in charge.<br />
Arrived within the haven<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_1-30">[30]</a> deep, their sails<br />
Furling, they stowed them in the bark below.<span class="lnm">535</span><br />
Then by its tackle lowering swift the mast<br />
Into its crutch, they briskly push'd to land,<br />
Heaved anchors out, and moor'd the vessel fast.<br />
Forth came the mariners, and trod the beach;<br />
Forth came the victims of Apollo next,<span class="lnm">540</span><br />
And, last, Chrys&euml;is. Her Ulysses led<br />
Toward the altar, gave her to the arms<br />
Of her own father, and him thus address'd.</p>
<p>O Chryses! Agamemnon, King of men,<br />
Hath sent thy daughter home, with whom we bring<span class="lnm">545</span><br />
A Hecatomb on all our host's behalf<br />
To Ph&oelig;bus, hoping to appease the God<br />
<span class="pgnm">022</span><a name="page_022" id="page_022"></a>
By whose dread shafts the Argives now expire.</p>
<p>So saying, he gave her to him, who with joy<br />
Received his daughter. Then, before the shrine<span class="lnm">550</span><br />
Magnificent in order due they ranged<br />
The noble Hecatomb.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_1-31">[31]</a> Each laved his hands<br />
And took the salted meal, and Chryses made<br />
His fervent prayer with hands upraised on high.</p>
<p>God of the silver bow, who with thy power<span class="lnm">555</span><br />
Encirclest Chrysa, and who reign'st supreme<br />
In Tenedos, and Cilla the divine!<br />
Thou prov'dst propitious to my first request,<br />
Hast honor'd me, and punish'd sore the Greeks;<br />
Hear yet thy servant's prayer; take from their host<span class="lnm">560</span><br />
At once the loathsome pestilence away!</p>
<p>So Chryses prayed, whom Ph&oelig;bus heard well-pleased;<br />
Then prayed the Grecians also, and with meal<br />
Sprinkling the victims, their retracted necks<br />
First pierced, then flay'd them; the disjointed thighs<span class="lnm">565</span><br />
They, next, invested with the double caul,<br />
Which with crude slices thin they overspread.<br />
The priest burned incense, and libation poured<br />
Large on the hissing brands, while, him beside,<br />
Busy with spit and prong, stood many a youth<span class="lnm">570</span><br />
Trained to the task. The thighs with fire consumed,<br />
They gave to each his portion of the maw,<br />
Then slashed the remnant, pierced it with the spits,<br />
And managing with culinary skill<br />
The roast, withdrew it from the spits again.<span class="lnm">575</span><br />
Their whole task thus accomplish'd, and the board<br />
<span class="pgnm">023</span><a name="page_023" id="page_023"></a>
Set forth, they feasted, and were all sufficed.<br />
When neither hunger more nor thirst remained<br />
Unsatisfied, boys crown'd the beakers high<br />
With wine delicious, and from right to left<span class="lnm">580</span><br />
Distributing the cups, served every guest.<br />
Thenceforth the youths of the Achaian race<br />
To song propitiatory gave the day,<br />
P&aelig;ans<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_1-32">[32]</a> to Ph&oelig;bus, Archer of the skies,<br />
Chaunting melodious. Pleased, Apollo heard.<span class="lnm">585</span><br />
But, when, the sun descending, darkness fell,<br />
They on the beach beside their hawsers slept;<br />
And, when the day-spring's daughter rosy-palm'd<br />
Aurora look'd abroad, then back they steer'd<br />
To the vast camp. Fair wind, and blowing fresh,<span class="lnm">590</span><br />
Apollo sent them; quick they rear'd the mast,<br />
Then spread the unsullied canvas to the gale,<br />
And the wind filled it. Roared the sable flood<br />
Around the bark, that ever as she went<br />
Dash'd wide the brine, and scudded swift away.<span class="lnm">595</span><br />
Thus reaching soon the spacious camp of Greece,<br />
Their galley they updrew sheer o'er the sands<br />
From the rude surge remote, then propp'd her sides<br />
With scantlings long,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_1-33">[33]</a> and sought their several tents.</p>
<p>But Peleus' noble son, the speed-renown'd<span class="lnm">600</span><br />
Achilles, he, his well-built bark beside,<br />
Consumed his hours, nor would in council more,<br />
Where wise men win distinction, or in fight<br />
Appear, to sorrow and heart-withering wo<br />
Abandon'd; though for battle, ardent, still<span class="lnm">605</span><br />
He panted, and the shout-resounding field.<br />
But when the twelfth fair morrow streak'd the East,<br />
<span class="pgnm">024</span><a name="page_024" id="page_024"></a>
Then all the everlasting Gods to Heaven<br />
Resorted, with the Thunderer at their head,<br />
And Thetis, not unmindful of her son,<span class="lnm">610</span><br />
Prom the salt flood emerged, seeking betimes<br />
Olympus and the boundless fields of heaven.<br />
High, on the topmost eminence sublime<br />
Of the deep-fork'd Olympian she perceived<br />
The Thunderer seated, from the Gods apart.<span class="lnm">615</span><br />
She sat before him, clasp'd with her left hand<br />
His knees, her right beneath his chin she placed,<br />
And thus the King, Saturnian Jove, implored.</p>
<p>Father of all, by all that I have done<br />
Or said that ever pleased thee, grant my suit.<span class="lnm">620</span><br />
Exalt my son, by destiny short-lived<br />
Beyond the lot of others. Him with shame<br />
The King of men hath overwhelm'd, by force<br />
Usurping his just meed; thou, therefore, Jove,<br />
Supreme in wisdom, honor him, and give<span class="lnm">625</span><br />
Success to Troy, till all Achaia's sons<br />
Shall yield him honor more than he hath lost!</p>
<p>She spake, to whom the Thunderer nought replied,<br />
But silent sat long time. She, as her hand<br />
Had grown there, still importunate, his knees<span class="lnm">630</span><br />
Clasp'd as at first, and thus her suit renew'd.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_1-34">[34]</a></p>
<p>Or grant my prayer, and ratify the grant,<br />
Or send me hence (for thou hast none to fear)<br />
Plainly refused; that I may know and feel<br />
By how much I am least of all in heaven.<span class="lnm">635</span></p>
<p>To whom the cloud-assembler at the last<br />
Spake, deep-distress'd. Hard task and full of strife<br />
Thou hast enjoined me; Juno will not spare<br />
For gibe and taunt injurious, whose complaint<br />
Sounds daily in the ears of all the Gods,<span class="lnm">640</span><br />
That I assist the Trojans; but depart,<br />
Lest she observe thee; my concern shall be<br />
How best I may perform thy full desire.<br />
<span class="pgnm">025</span><a name="page_025" id="page_025"></a>
And to assure thee more, I give the sign<br />
Indubitable, which all fear expels<span class="lnm">645</span><br />
At once from heavenly minds. Nought, so confirmed,<br />
May, after, be reversed or render'd vain.</p>
<p>He ceased, and under his dark brows the nod<br />
Vouchsafed of confirmation. All around<br />
The Sovereign's everlasting head his curls<span class="lnm">650</span><br />
Ambrosial shook,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_1-35">[35]</a> and the huge mountain reeled.</p>
<p>Their conference closed, they parted. She, at once,<br />
From bright Olympus plunged into the flood<br />
Profound, and Jove to his own courts withdrew.<br />
Together all the Gods, at his approach,<span class="lnm">655</span><br />
Uprose; none sat expectant till he came,<br />
But all advanced to meet the Eternal Sire.<br />
So on his throne he sat. Nor Juno him<br />
Not understood; she, watchful, had observed,<br />
In consultation close with Jove engaged<span class="lnm">660</span><br />
Thetis, bright-footed daughter of the deep,<br />
And keen the son of Saturn thus reproved.</p>
<p>Shrewd as thou art, who now hath had thine ear?<br />
Thy joy is ever such, from me apart<br />
To plan and plot clandestine, and thy thoughts,<span class="lnm">665</span><br />
Think what thou may'st, are always barred to me.</p>
<p>To whom the father, thus, of heaven and earth.<br />
Expect not, Juno, that thou shalt partake<br />
My counsels at all times, which oft in height<br />
And depth, thy comprehension far exceed,<span class="lnm">670</span><br />
Jove's consort as thou art. When aught occurs<br />
Meet for thine ear, to none will I impart<br />
Of Gods or men more free than to thyself.<br />
But for my secret thoughts, which I withhold<br />
From all in heaven beside, them search not thou<span class="lnm">675</span><br />
With irksome curiosity and vain.</p>
<p><span class="pgnm">026</span><a name="page_026" id="page_026"></a>
Him answer'd then the Goddess ample-eyed.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_1-36">[36]</a><br />
What word hath passed thy lips, Saturnian Jove,<br />
Thou most severe! I never search thy thoughts,<br />
Nor the serenity of thy profound<span class="lnm">680</span><br />
Intentions trouble; they are safe from me:<br />
But now there seems a cause. Deeply I dread<br />
Lest Thetis, silver-footed daughter fair<br />
Of Ocean's hoary Sovereign, here arrived<br />
At early dawn to practise on thee, Jove!<span class="lnm">685</span><br />
I noticed her a suitress at thy knees,<br />
And much misdeem or promise-bound thou stand'st<br />
To Thetis past recall, to exalt her son,<br />
And Greeks to slaughter thousands at the ships.</p>
<p>To whom the cloud-assembler God, incensed.<span class="lnm">690</span><br />
Ah subtle! ever teeming with surmise,<br />
And fathomer of my concealed designs,<br />
Thy toil is vain, or (which is worse for thee,)<br />
Shall but estrange thee from mine heart the more.<br />
And be it as thou sayest,&mdash;I am well pleased<span class="lnm">695</span><br />
That so it should be. Be advised, desist,<br />
Hold thou thy peace. Else, if my glorious hands<br />
Once reach thee, the Olympian Powers combined<br />
To rescue thee, shall interfere in vain.</p>
<p>He said,&mdash;whom Juno, awful Goddess, heard<span class="lnm">700</span><br />
Appall'd, and mute submitted to his will.<br />
But through the courts of Jove the heavenly Powers<br />
All felt displeasure; when to them arose<br />
Vulcan, illustrious artist, who with speech<br />
Conciliatory interposed to sooth<span class="lnm">705</span><br />
His white-armed mother Juno, Goddess dread.</p>
<p>Hard doom is ours, and not to be endured,<br />
<span class="pgnm">027</span><a name="page_027" id="page_027"></a>
If feast and merriment must pause in heaven<br />
While ye such clamor raise tumultuous here<br />
For man's unworthy sake: yet thus we speed<span class="lnm">710</span><br />
Ever, when evil overpoises good.<br />
But I exhort my mother, though herself<br />
Already warn'd, that meekly she submit<br />
To Jove our father, lest our father chide<br />
More roughly, and confusion mar the feast.<span class="lnm">715</span><br />
For the Olympian Thunderer could with ease<br />
Us from our thrones precipitate, so far<br />
He reigns to all superior. Seek to assuage<br />
His anger therefore; so shall he with smiles<br />
Cheer thee, nor thee alone, but all in heaven.<span class="lnm">720</span></p>
<p>So Vulcan, and, upstarting, placed a cup<br />
Full-charged between his mother's hands, and said,</p>
<p>My mother, be advised, and, though aggrieved,<br />
Yet patient; lest I see thee whom I love<br />
So dear, with stripes chastised before my face,<span class="lnm">725</span><br />
Willing, but impotent to give thee aid.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_1-37">[37]</a><br />
Who can resist the Thunderer? Me, when once<br />
I flew to save thee, by the foot he seized<br />
And hurl'd me through the portal of the skies.<br />
"From morn to eve I fell, a summer's day,"<span class="lnm">730</span><br />
And dropped, at last, in Lemnos. There half-dead<br />
The Sintians found me, and with succor prompt<br />
And hospitable, entertained me fallen.</p>
<p>So He; then Juno smiled, Goddess white-arm'd,<br />
And smiling still, from his unwonted hand<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_1-38">[38]</a><span class="lnm">735</span><br />
Received the goblet. He from right to left<br />
Rich nectar from the beaker drawn, alert<br />
Distributed to all the powers divine.<br />
<span class="pgnm">028</span><a name="page_028" id="page_028"></a>
Heaven rang with laughter inextinguishable<br />
Peal after peal, such pleasure all conceived<span class="lnm">740</span><br />
At sight of Vulcan in his new employ.</p>
<p>So spent they in festivity the day,<br />
And all were cheered; nor was Apollo's harp<br />
Silent, nor did the Muses spare to add<br />
Responsive melody of vocal sweets.<span class="lnm">745</span><br />
But when the sun's bright orb had now declined,<br />
Each to his mansion, wheresoever built<br />
By the lame matchless Architect, withdrew.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_1-39">[39]</a><br />
Jove also, kindler of the fires of heaven,<br />
His couch ascending as at other times<span class="lnm">750</span><br />
When gentle sleep approach'd him, slept serene,<br />
With golden-sceptred Juno at his side.</p>

<p>The first book contains the preliminaries to the commencement of serious
action. First, the visit of the priest of Apollo to ransom his captive
daughter, the refusal of Agamemnon to yield her up, and the pestilence sent
by the god upon the Grecian army in consequence. Secondly, the restoration,
the propitiation of Apollo, the quarrel of Agamemnon and Achilles,
and the withdrawing of the latter from the Grecian army. Thirdly, the
intercession of Thetis with Jupiter; his promise, unwillingly given, to
avenge Achilles; and the assembly of the gods, in which the promise is
angrily alluded to by Juno, and the discussion peremptorily checked by Jupiter.
The poet, throughout this book, maintains a simple, unadorned
style, but highly descriptive, and happily adapted to the nature of the subject.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Felton</span>.</p>

<p class="outd">Jupiter, in pursuance of his purpose to distress the Grecians in answer to
the prayer of Thetis, deceives Agamemnon by a dream. He, in consequence
of it, calls a council, the result of which is that the army shall
go forth to battle. Thersites is mutinous, and is chastised by Ulysses.
Ulysses, Nestor, and Agamemnon, harangue the people; and preparation
is made for battle. An exact account follows of the forces on both sides.</p>

<p class="noind"><a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_2-1">[1]</a>All night both Gods and Chiefs equestrian slept,<br />
But not the Sire of all. He, waking soon,<br />
Mused how to exalt Achilles, and destroy<br />
No few in battle at the Grecian fleet.<br />
This counsel, at the last, as best he chose<span class="lnm">5</span><br />
And likeliest; to dispatch an evil Dream<br />
To Agamemnon's tent, and to his side<br />
The phantom summoning, him thus addressed.</p>
<p>Haste, evil Dream! Fly to the Grecian fleet,<br />
And, entering royal Agamemnon's tent,<span class="lnm">10</span><br />
His ear possess thou thus, omitting nought<br />
Of all that I enjoin thee. Bid him arm<br />
His universal host, for that the time<br />
When the Achaians shall at length possess<br />
Wide Ilium, hath arrived. The Gods above<span class="lnm">15</span><br />
No longer dwell at variance. The request<br />
Of Juno hath prevail'd; now, wo to Troy!<br />
So charged, the Dream departed. At the ships<br />
Well-built arriving of Achaia's host,<br />
He Agamemnon, son of Atreus, sought.<span class="lnm">20</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">032</span><a name="page_032" id="page_032"></a>
Him sleeping in his tent he found, immersed<br />
In soft repose ambrosial. At his head<br />
The shadow stood, similitude exact<br />
Of Nestor, son of Neleus; sage, with whom<br />
In Agamemnon's thought might none compare.<span class="lnm">25</span><br />
His form assumed, the sacred Dream began.</p>
<p>Oh son of Atreus the renown'd in arms<br />
And in the race! Sleep'st thou? It ill behoves<br />
To sleep all night the man of high employ,<br />
And charged, as thou art, with a people's care.<span class="lnm">30</span><br />
Now, therefore, mark me well, who, sent from Jove,<br />
Inform thee, that although so far remote,<br />
He yet compassionates and thinks on thee<br />
With kind solicitude. He bids thee arm<br />
Thy universal host, for that the time<span class="lnm">35</span><br />
When the Achaians shall at length possess<br />
Wide Ilium, hath arrived. The Gods above<br />
No longer dwell at variance. The requests<br />
Of Juno have prevail'd. Now, wo to Troy<br />
From Jove himself! Her fate is on the wing.<span class="lnm">40</span><br />
Awaking from thy dewy slumbers, hold<br />
In firm remembrance all that thou hast heard.</p>
<p>So spake the Dream, and vanishing, him left<br />
In false hopes occupied and musings vain.<br />
Full sure he thought, ignorant of the plan<span class="lnm">45</span><br />
By Jove design'd, that day the last of Troy.<br />
Fond thought! For toils and agonies to Greeks<br />
And Trojans both, in many a bloody field<br />
To be endured, the Thunderer yet ordain'd.<br />
Starting he woke, and seeming still to hear<span class="lnm">50</span><br />
The warning voice divine, with hasty leap<br />
Sprang from his bed, and sat.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_2-2">[2]</a> His fleecy vest<br />
<span class="pgnm">033</span><a name="page_033" id="page_033"></a>
New-woven he put on, and mantle wide;<br />
His sandals fair to his unsullied feet<br />
He braced, and slung his argent-studded sword.<span class="lnm">55</span><br />
Then, incorruptible for evermore<br />
The sceptre of his sires he took, with which<br />
He issued forth into the camp of Greece.</p>
<p>Aurora now on the Olympian heights<br />
Proclaiming stood new day to all in heaven,<span class="lnm">60</span><br />
When he his clear-voiced heralds bade convene<br />
The Greeks in council. Went the summons forth<br />
Into all quarters, and the throng began.<br />
First, at the ship of Nestor, Pylian King,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_2-3">[3]</a><br />
The senior Chiefs for high exploits renown'd<span class="lnm">65</span><br />
He gather'd, whom he prudent thus address'd.</p>
<p>My fellow warriors, hear! A dream from heaven,<br />
Amid the stillness of the vacant night<br />
Approach'd me, semblance close in stature, bulk,<br />
And air, of noble Nestor. At mine head<span class="lnm">70</span><br />
The shadow took his stand, and thus he spake.</p>
<p>Oh son of Atreus the renown'd in arms<br />
And in the race, sleep'st thou? It ill behoves<br />
To sleep all night the man of high employ,<br />
And charged as thou art with a people's care.<span class="lnm">75</span><br />
Now, therefore, mark me well, who, sent from Jove,<br />
Inform thee, that although so far remote,<br />
He yet compassionates and thinks on thee<br />
With kind solicitude. He bids thee arm<br />
Thy universal host; for that the time<span class="lnm">80</span><br />
When the Achaians shall at length possess<br />
Wide Ilium, hath arrived. The Gods above<br />
No longer dwell at variance. The requests<br />
Of Juno have prevail'd. Now, wo to Troy<br />
From Jove himself! Her fate is on the wing.<span class="lnm">85</span><br />
Charge this on thy remembrance. Thus he spake,<br />
Then vanished suddenly, and I awoke.<br />
Haste therefore, let us arm, if arm we may,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_2-4">[4]</a><br />
<span class="pgnm">034</span><a name="page_034" id="page_034"></a>
The warlike sons of Greece; but first, myself<br />
Will prove them, recommending instant flight<span class="lnm">90</span><br />
With all our ships, and ye throughout the host<br />
Dispersed, shall, next, encourage all to stay.</p>
<p>He ceased, and sat; when in the midst arose<br />
Of highest fame for wisdom, Nestor, King<br />
Of sandy Pylus, who them thus bespake.<span class="lnm">95</span></p>
<p>Friends, Counsellors, and Leaders of the Greeks!<br />
Had any meaner Argive told his dream,<br />
We had pronounced it false, and should the more<br />
Have shrunk from battle; but the dream is his<br />
Who boasts himself our highest in command.<span class="lnm">100</span><br />
Haste, arm we, if we may, the sons of Greece.</p>
<p>So saying, he left the council; him, at once<br />
The sceptred Chiefs, obedient to his voice,<br />
Arising, follow'd; and the throng began.<br />
As from the hollow rock bees stream abroad,<span class="lnm">105</span><br />
And in succession endless seek the fields,<br />
Now clustering, and now scattered far and near,<br />
In spring-time, among all the new-blown flowers,<br />
So they to council swarm'd, troop after troop,<br />
Grecians of every tribe, from camp and fleet<span class="lnm">110</span><br />
Assembling orderly o'er all the plain<br />
Beside the shore of Ocean. In the midst<br />
A kindling rumor, messenger of Jove,<br />
Impell'd them, and they went. Loud was the din<br />
Of the assembling thousands; groan'd the earth<span class="lnm">115</span><br />
When down they sat, and murmurs ran around.<br />
Nine heralds cried aloud&mdash;Will ye restrain<br />
Your clamors, that your heaven-taught Kings may speak?<br />
Scarce were they settled, and the clang had ceased,<br />
When Agamemnon, sovereign o'er them all,<span class="lnm">120</span><br />
Sceptre in hand, arose. (That sceptre erst<br />
Vulcan with labor forged, and to the hand<br />
Consign'd it of the King, Saturnian Jove;<br />
<span class="pgnm">035</span><a name="page_035" id="page_035"></a>
Jove to the vanquisher<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_2-5">[5]</a> of Ino's<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_2-6">[6]</a> guard,<br />
And he to Pelops; Pelops in his turn,<span class="lnm">125</span><br />
To royal Atreus; Atreus at his death<br />
Bequeath'd it to Thyestes rich in flocks,<br />
And rich Thyestes left it to be borne<br />
By Agamemnon, symbol of his right<br />
To empire over Argos and her isles)<span class="lnm">130</span><br />
On that he lean'd, and rapid, thus began.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_2-7">[7]</a></p>
<p>Friends, Grecian Heroes, ministers of Mars!<br />
Ye see me here entangled in the snares<br />
Of unpropitious Jove. He promised once,<br />
And with a nod confirm'd it, that with spoils<span class="lnm">135</span><br />
Of Ilium laden, we should hence return;<br />
But now, devising ill, he sends me shamed,<br />
And with diminished numbers, home to Greece.<br />
So stands his sovereign pleasure, who hath laid<br />
The bulwarks of full many a city low,<span class="lnm">140</span><br />
And more shall level, matchless in his might.<br />
That such a numerous host of Greeks as we,<br />
Warring with fewer than ourselves, should find<br />
No fruit of all our toil, (and none appears)<br />
Will make us vile with ages yet to come.<span class="lnm">145</span><br />
For should we now strike truce, till Greece and Troy<br />
Might number each her own, and were the Greeks<br />
Distributed in bands, ten Greeks in each,<br />
Our banded decads should exceed so far<br />
Their units, that all Troy could not supply<span class="lnm">150</span><br />
For every ten, a man, to fill us wine;<br />
So far the Achaians, in my thought, surpass<br />
The native Trojans. But in Troy are those<br />
Who baffle much my purpose; aids derived<br />
From other states, spear-arm'd auxiliars, firm<span class="lnm">155</span><br />
In the defence of Ilium's lofty towers.<br />
<span class="pgnm">036</span><a name="page_036" id="page_036"></a>
Nine years have passed us over, nine long years;<br />
Our ships are rotted, and our tackle marr'd,<br />
And all our wives and little-ones at home<br />
Sit watching our return, while this attempt<span class="lnm">160</span><br />
Hangs still in doubt, for which that home we left.<br />
Accept ye then my counsel. Fly we swift<br />
With all our fleet back to our native land,<br />
Hopeless of Troy, not yet to be subdued.</p>
<p>So spake the King, whom all the concourse heard<span class="lnm">165</span><br />
With minds in tumult toss'd; all, save the few,<br />
Partners of his intent. Commotion shook<br />
The whole assembly, such as heaves the flood<br />
Of the Icarian Deep, when South and East<br />
Burst forth together from the clouds of Jove.<span class="lnm">170</span><br />
And as when vehement the West-wind falls<br />
On standing corn mature, the loaded ears<br />
Innumerable bow before the gale,<br />
So was the council shaken. With a shout<br />
All flew toward the ships; uprais'd, the dust<span class="lnm">175</span><br />
Stood o'er them; universal was the cry,<br />
"Now clear the passages, strike down the props,<br />
Set every vessel free, launch, and away!"<br />
Heaven rang with exclamation of the host<br />
All homeward bent, and launching glad the fleet.<span class="lnm">180</span><br />
Then baffled Fate had the Achaians seen<br />
Returning premature, but Juno thus,<br />
With admonition quick to Pallas spake.</p>
<p>Unconquer'd daughter of Jove &AElig;gis-arm'd!<br />
Ah foul dishonor! Is it thus at last<span class="lnm">185</span><br />
That the Achaians on the billows borne,<br />
Shall seek again their country, leaving here,<br />
To be the vaunt of Ilium and her King,<br />
Helen of Argos, in whose cause the Greeks<br />
Have numerous perish'd from their home remote?<span class="lnm">190</span><br />
Haste! Seek the mail-arm'd multitude, by force<br />
Detain them of thy soothing speech, ere yet<br />
All launch their oary barks into the flood.</p>
<p>She spake, nor did Minerva not comply,<br />
<span class="pgnm">037</span><a name="page_037" id="page_037"></a>
But darting swift from the Olympian heights,<span class="lnm">195</span><br />
Reach'd soon Achaia's fleet. There, she perceived<br />
Prudent as Jove himself, Ulysses; firm<br />
He stood; he touch'd not even with his hand<br />
His sable bark, for sorrow whelm'd his soul.<br />
The Athen&aelig;an Goddess azure-eyed<span class="lnm">200</span><br />
Beside him stood, and thus the Chief bespake.</p>
<p>Laertes' noble son, for wiles renown'd!<br />
Why seek ye, thus precipitate, your ships?<br />
Intend ye flight? And is it thus at last,<br />
That the Achaians on the billows borne,<span class="lnm">205</span><br />
Shall seek again their country, leaving here,<br />
To be the vaunt of Ilium and her King,<br />
Helen of Argos, in whose cause the Greeks<br />
Have numerous perish'd from their home remote?<br />
Delay not. Rush into the throng; by force<span class="lnm">210</span><br />
Detain them of thy soothing speech, ere yet<br />
All launch their oary barks into the flood.</p>
<p>She ceased, whom by her voice Ulysses knew,<br />
Casting his mantle from him, which his friend<br />
Eurybates the Ithacensian caught,<span class="lnm">215</span><br />
He ran; and in his course meeting the son<br />
Of Atreus, Agamemnon, from his hand<br />
The everlasting sceptre quick received,<br />
Which bearing, through Achaia's fleet he pass'd.<br />
What King soever, or distinguish'd Greek<span class="lnm">220</span><br />
He found, approaching to his side, in terms<br />
Of gentle sort he stay'd him. Sir, he cried,<br />
It is unseemly that a man renown'd<br />
As thou, should tremble. Go&mdash;Resume the seat<br />
Which thou hast left, and bid the people sit.<span class="lnm">225</span><br />
Thou know'st not clearly yet the monarch's mind.<br />
He proves us now, but soon he will chastize.<br />
All were not present; few of us have heard<br />
His speech this day in council. Oh, beware,<br />
Lest in resentment of this hasty course<span class="lnm">230</span><br />
Irregular, he let his anger loose.<br />
Dread is the anger of a King; he reigns<br />
<span class="pgnm">038</span><a name="page_038" id="page_038"></a>
By Jove's own ordinance, and is dear to Jove,</p>
<p>But what plebeian base soe'er he heard<br />
Stretching his throat to swell the general cry,<span class="lnm">235</span><br />
He laid the sceptre smartly on his back,<br />
With reprimand severe. Fellow, he said,<br />
Sit still; hear others; thy superiors hear.<br />
For who art thou? A dastard and a drone,<br />
Of none account in council, or in arms.<span class="lnm">240</span><br />
By no means may we all alike bear sway<br />
At Ilium; such plurality of Kings<br />
Were evil. One suffices. One, to whom<br />
The son of politic Saturn hath assign'd<br />
The sceptre, and inforcement of the laws,<span class="lnm">245</span><br />
That he may rule us as a monarch ought.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_2-8">[8]</a></p>
<p>With such authority the troubled host<br />
He sway'd; they, quitting camp and fleet again<br />
Rush'd back to council; deafening was the sound<br />
As when a billow of the boisterous deep<span class="lnm">250</span><br />
Some broad beach dashes, and the Ocean roars.</p>
<p>The host all seated, and the benches fill'd,<br />
Thersites only of loquacious tongue<br />
Ungovern'd, clamor'd mutinous; a wretch<br />
Of utterance prompt, but in coarse phrase obscene<span class="lnm">255</span><br />
Deep learn'd alone, with which to slander Kings.<br />
Might he but set the rabble in a roar,<br />
He cared not with what jest; of all from Greece<br />
To Ilium sent, his country's chief reproach.<br />
Cross-eyed he was, and halting moved on legs<span class="lnm">260</span><br />
Ill-pair'd; his gibbous shoulders o'er his breast<br />
<span class="pgnm">039</span><a name="page_039" id="page_039"></a>
Contracted, pinch'd it; to a peak his head<br />
Was moulded sharp, and sprinkled thin with hair<br />
Of starveling length, flimsy and soft as down.<br />
Achilles and Ulysses had incurr'd<span class="lnm">265</span><br />
Most his aversion; them he never spared;<br />
But now, imperial Agamemnon 'self<br />
In piercing accents stridulous he charged<br />
With foul reproach. The Grecians with contempt<br />
Listen'd, and indignation, while with voice<span class="lnm">270</span><br />
At highest pitch, he thus the monarch mock'd.</p>
<p>What wouldst thou now? Whereof is thy complaint<br />
Now, Agamemnon? Thou hast fill'd thy tents<br />
With treasure, and the Grecians, when they take<br />
A city, choose the loveliest girls for thee.<span class="lnm">275</span><br />
Is gold thy wish? More gold? A ransom brought<br />
By some chief Trojan for his son's release<br />
Whom I, or other valiant Greek may bind?<br />
Or wouldst thou yet a virgin, one, by right<br />
Another's claim, but made by force thine own?<span class="lnm">280</span><br />
It was not well, great Sir, that thou shouldst bring<br />
A plague on the Achaians, as of late.<br />
But come, my Grecian sisters, soldiers named<br />
Unfitly, of a sex too soft for war,<br />
Come, let us homeward: let him here digest<span class="lnm">285</span><br />
What he shall gorge, alone; that he may learn<br />
If our assistance profit him or not.<br />
For when he shamed Achilles, he disgraced<br />
A Chief far worthier than himself, whose prize<br />
He now withholds. But tush,&mdash;Achilles lacks<span class="lnm">290</span><br />
Himself the spirit of a man; no gall<br />
Hath he within him, or his hand long since<br />
Had stopp'd that mouth,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_2-9">[9]</a> that it should scoff no more.</p>
<p>Thus, mocking royal Agamemnon, spake<br />
Thersites. Instant starting to his side,<br /><span class="lnm">295</span><br />
Noble Ulysses with indignant brows<br />
Survey'd him, and him thus reproved severe.</p>
<p><span class="pgnm">040</span><a name="page_040" id="page_040"></a>
Thersites! Railer!&mdash;peace. Think not thyself,<br />
Although thus eloquent, alone exempt<br />
From obligation not to slander Kings.<span class="lnm">300</span><br />
I deem thee most contemptible, the worst<br />
Of Agamemnon's followers to the war;<br />
Presume not then to take the names revered<br />
Of Sovereigns on thy sordid lips, to asperse<br />
Their sacred character, and to appoint<span class="lnm">305</span><br />
The Greeks a time when they shall voyage home.<br />
How soon, how late, with what success at last<br />
We shall return, we know not: but because<br />
Achaia's heroes numerous spoils allot<br />
To Agamemnon, Leader of the host,<span class="lnm">310</span><br />
Thou therefore from thy seat revilest the King.<br />
But mark me. If I find thee, as even now,<br />
Raving and foaming at the lips again,<br />
May never man behold Ulysses' head<br />
On these my shoulders more, and may my son<span class="lnm">315</span><br />
Prove the begotten of another Sire,<br />
If I not strip thee to that hide of thine<br />
As bare as thou wast born, and whip thee hence<br />
Home to thy galley, sniveling like a boy.</p>
<p>He ceased, and with his sceptre on the back<span class="lnm">320</span><br />
And shoulders smote him. Writhing to and fro,<br />
He wept profuse, while many a bloody whelk<br />
Protuberant beneath the sceptre sprang.<br />
Awe-quell'd he sat, and from his visage mean,<br />
Deep-sighing, wiped the rheums. It was no time<span class="lnm">325</span><br />
For mirth, yet mirth illumined every face,<br />
And laughing, thus they spake. A thousand acts<br />
Illustrious, both by well-concerted plans<br />
And prudent disposition of the host<br />
Ulysses hath achieved, but this by far<span class="lnm">330</span><br />
Transcends his former praise, that he hath quell'd<br />
Such contumelious rhetoric profuse.<br />
The valiant talker shall not soon, we judge,<br />
Take liberties with royal names again.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_2-10">[10]</a><br />
<span class="pgnm">041</span><a name="page_041" id="page_041"></a>
So spake the multitude. Then, stretching forth<span class="lnm">335</span><br />
The sceptre, city-spoiler Chief, arose<br />
Ulysses. Him beside, herald in form,<br />
Appeared Minerva. Silence she enjoined<br />
To all, that all Achaia's sons might hear,<br />
Foremost and rearmost, and might weigh his words.<span class="lnm">340</span><br />
He then his counsel, prudent, thus proposed.</p>
<p>Atrides! Monarch! The Achaians seek<br />
To make thee ignominious above all<br />
In sight of all mankind. None recollects<br />
His promise more in steed-famed Argos pledged,<span class="lnm">345</span><br />
Here to abide till Ilium wall'd to heaven<br />
Should vanquish'd sink, and all her wealth be ours.<br />
No&mdash;now, like widow'd women, or weak boys,<br />
They whimper to each other, wishing home.<br />
And home, I grant, to the afflicted soul<span class="lnm">350</span><br />
Seems pleasant.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_2-11">[11]</a> The poor seaman from his wife<br />
One month detain'd, cheerless his ship and sad<br />
Possesses, by the force of wintry blasts,<br />
And by the billows of the troubled deep<br />
Fast lock'd in port. But us the ninth long year<span class="lnm">355</span><br />
Revolving, finds camp'd under Ilium still.<br />
I therefore blame not, if they mourn beside<br />
Their sable barks, the Grecians. Yet the shame<br />
That must attend us after absence long<br />
Returning unsuccessful, who can bear?<span class="lnm">360</span><br />
Be patient, friends! wait only till we learn<br />
If Calchas truly prophesied, or not;<br />
For well we know, and I to all appeal,<br />
Whom Fate hath not already snatch'd away,<br />
(It seems but yesterday, or at the most<span class="lnm">365</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">042</span><a name="page_042" id="page_042"></a>
A day or two before) that when the ships<br />
Wo-fraught for Priam, and the race of Troy,<br />
At Aulis met, and we beside the fount<br />
With perfect hecatombs the Gods adored<br />
Beneath the plane-tree, from whose root a stream<span class="lnm">370</span><br />
Ran crystal-clear, there we beheld a sign<br />
Wonderful in all eyes. A serpent huge,<br />
Tremendous spectacle! with crimson spots<br />
His back all dappled, by Olympian Jove<br />
Himself protruded, from the altar's foot<span class="lnm">375</span><br />
Slipp'd into light, and glided to the tree.<br />
There on the topmost bough, close-cover'd sat<br />
With foliage broad, eight sparrows, younglings all,<br />
Then newly feather'd, with their dam, the ninth.<br />
The little ones lamenting shrill he gorged,<span class="lnm">380</span><br />
While, wheeling o'er his head, with screams the dam<br />
Bewail'd her darling brood. Her also next,<br />
Hovering and clamoring, he by the wing<br />
Within his spiry folds drew, and devoured.<br />
All eaten thus, the nestlings and the dam,<span class="lnm">385</span><br />
The God who sent him, signalized him too,<br />
For him Saturnian Jove transform'd to stone.<br />
We wondering stood, to see that strange portent<br />
Intrude itself into our holy rites,<br />
When Calchas, instant, thus the sign explain'd.<span class="lnm">390</span></p>
<p>Why stand ye, Greeks, astonish'd? Ye behold<br />
A prodigy by Jove himself produced,<br />
An omen, whose accomplishment indeed<br />
Is distant, but whose fame shall never die.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_2-12">[12]</a><br />
E'en as this serpent in your sight devour'd<span class="lnm">395</span><br />
Eight youngling sparrows, with their dam, the ninth,<br />
So we nine years must war on yonder plain,<br />
And in the tenth, wide-bulwark'd Troy is ours.</p>
<p>So spake the seer, and as he spake, is done.<br />
<span class="pgnm">043</span><a name="page_043" id="page_043"></a>
Wait, therefore, brave Achaians! go not hence<span class="lnm">400</span><br />
Till Priam's spacious city be your prize.</p>
<p>He ceased, and such a shout ensued, that all<br />
The hollow ships the deafening roar return'd<br />
Of acclamation, every voice the speech<br />
Extolling of Ulysses, glorious Chief.<span class="lnm">405</span></p>
<p>Then Nestor the Gerenian,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_2-13">[13]</a> warrior old,<br />
Arising, spake; and, by the Gods, he said,<br />
Ye more resemble children inexpert<br />
In war, than disciplined and prudent men.<br />
Where now are all your promises and vows,<span class="lnm">410</span><br />
Councils, libations, right-hand covenants?<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_2-14">[14]</a><br />
Burn them, since all our occupation here<br />
Is to debate and wrangle, whereof end<br />
Or fruit though long we wait, shall none be found.<br />
But, Sovereign, be not thou appall'd. Be firm.<span class="lnm">415</span><br />
Relax not aught of thine accustomed sway,<br />
But set the battle forth as thou art wont.<br />
And if there be a Grecian, here and there,<br />
One,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_2-15">[15]</a> adverse to the general voice, let such<br />
Wither alone. He shall not see his wish<span class="lnm">420</span><br />
Gratified, neither will we hence return<br />
To Argos, ere events shall yet have proved<br />
Jove's promise false or true. For when we climb'd<br />
Our gallant barks full-charged with Ilium's fate,<br />
Saturnian Jove omnipotent, that day,<span class="lnm">425</span><br />
(Omen propitious!) thunder'd on the right.<br />
Let no man therefore pant for home, till each<br />
Possess a Trojan spouse, and from her lips<br />
<span class="pgnm">044</span><a name="page_044" id="page_044"></a>
Take sweet revenge for Helen's pangs of heart.<br />
Who then? What soldier languishes and sighs<span class="lnm">430</span><br />
To leave us? Let him dare to lay his hand<br />
On his own vessel, and he dies the first.<br />
But hear, O King! I shall suggest a course<br />
Not trivial. Agamemnon! sort the Greeks<br />
By districts and by tribes, that tribe may tribe<span class="lnm">435</span><br />
Support, and each his fellow. This performed,<br />
And with consent of all, thou shalt discern<br />
With ease what Chief, what private man deserts,<br />
And who performs his part. The base, the brave,<br />
Such disposition made, shall both appear;<span class="lnm">440</span><br />
And thou shalt also know, if heaven or we,<br />
The Gods, or our supineness, succor Troy.</p>
<p>To whom Atrides, King of men, replied.<br />
Old Chief! Thou passest all Achaia's sons<br />
In consultation; would to Jove our Sire,<span class="lnm">445</span><br />
To Athen&aelig;an Pallas, and Apollo!<br />
That I had ten such coadjutors, wise<br />
As thou art, and the royal city soon<br />
Of Priam, with her wealth, should all be ours.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_2-16">[16]</a><br />
But me the son of Saturn, Jove supreme<span class="lnm">450</span><br />
Himself afflicts, who in contentious broils<br />
Involves me, and in altercation vain.<br />
Thence all that wordy tempest for a girl<br />
Achilles and myself between, and I<br />
The fierce aggressor. Be that breach but heal'd!<span class="lnm">455</span><br />
And Troy's reprieve thenceforth is at an end.<br />
Go&mdash;take refreshment now that we may march<br />
Forth to our enemies. Let each whet well<br />
His spear, brace well his shield, well feed his brisk<br />
High-mettled horses, well survey and search<span class="lnm">460</span><br />
His chariot on all sides, that no defect<br />
Disgrace his bright habiliments of war.<br />
So will we give the day from morn to eve<br />
To dreadful battle. Pause there shall be none<br />
Till night divide us. Every buckler's thong<span class="lnm">465</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">045</span><a name="page_045" id="page_045"></a>
Shall sweat on the toil'd bosom, every hand<br />
That shakes the spear shall ache, and every steed<br />
Shall smoke that whirls the chariot o'er the plain.<br />
Wo then to whom I shall discover here<br />
Loitering among the tents; let him escape<span class="lnm">470</span><br />
My vengeance if he can. The vulture's maw<br />
Shall have his carcase, and the dogs his bones.</p>
<p>He spake; whom all applauded with a shout<br />
Loud as against some headland cliff the waves<br />
Roll'd by the stormy South o'er rocks that shoot<span class="lnm">475</span><br />
Afar into the deep, which in all winds<br />
The flood still overspreads, blow whence they may.<br />
Arising, forth they rush'd, among the ships<br />
All scatter'd; smoke from every tent arose,<br />
The host their food preparing; next, his God<span class="lnm">480</span><br />
Each man invoked (of the Immortals him<br />
Whom he preferr'd) with sacrifice and prayer<br />
For safe escape from danger and from death.<br />
But Agamemnon to Saturnian Jove<br />
Omnipotent, an ox of the fifth year<span class="lnm">485</span><br />
Full-flesh'd devoted, and the Princes call'd<br />
Noblest of all the Grecians to his feast.<br />
First, Nestor with Idomeneus the King,<br />
Then either Ajax, and the son he call'd<br />
Of Tydeus, with Ulysses sixth and last,<span class="lnm">490</span><br />
Jove's peer in wisdom. Menelaus went,<br />
Heroic Chief! unbidden, for he knew<br />
His brother's mind with weight of care oppress'd.<br />
The ox encircling, and their hands with meal<br />
Of consecration fill'd, the assembly stood,<span class="lnm">495</span><br />
When Agamemnon thus his prayer preferred.</p>
<p>Almighty Father! Glorious above all!<br />
Cloud-girt, who dwell'st in heaven thy throne sublime,<br />
Let not the sun go down, till Priam's roof<br />
Fall flat into the flames; till I shall burn<span class="lnm">500</span><br />
His gates with fire; till I shall hew away<br />
His hack'd and riven corslet from the breast<br />
Of Hector, and till numerous Chiefs, his friends,<br />
<span class="pgnm">046</span><a name="page_046" id="page_046"></a>
Around him, prone in dust, shall bite the ground.</p>
<p>So prayed he, but with none effect, The God<span class="lnm">505</span><br />
Received his offering, but to double toil<br />
Doom'd them, and sorrow more than all the past.</p>
<p>They then, the triturated barley grain<br />
First duly sprinkling, the sharp steel infix'd<br />
Deep in the victim's neck reversed, then stripp'd<span class="lnm">510</span><br />
The carcase, and divided at their joint<br />
The thighs, which in the double caul involved<br />
They spread with slices crude, and burn'd with fire<br />
Ascending fierce from billets sere and dry.<br />
The spitted entrails next they o'er the coals<span class="lnm">515</span><br />
Suspended held. The thighs with fire consumed,<br />
They gave to each his portion of the maw,<br />
Then slash'd the remnant, pierced it with the spits,<br />
And managing with culinary skill<br />
The roast, withdrew it from the spits again.<span class="lnm">520</span><br />
Thus, all their task accomplished, and the board<br />
Set forth, they feasted, and were all sufficed.<br />
When neither hunger more nor thirst remain'd<br />
Unsatisfied, Gerenian Nestor spake.</p>
<p>Atrides! Agamemnon! King of men!<span class="lnm">525</span><br />
No longer waste we time in useless words,<br />
Nor to a distant hour postpone the work<br />
To which heaven calls thee. Send thine heralds forth.<br />
Who shall convene the Achaians at the fleet,<br />
That we, the Chiefs assembled here, may range,<span class="lnm">530</span><br />
Together, the imbattled multitude,<br />
And edge their spirits for immediate fight.</p>
<p>He spake, nor Agamemnon not complied.<br />
At once he bade his clear-voiced heralds call<br />
The Greeks to battle. They the summons loud<span class="lnm">535</span><br />
Gave forth, and at the sound the people throng'd.<br />
Then Agamemnon and the Kings of Greece<br />
Dispatchful drew them into order just,<br />
With whom Minerva azure-eyed advanced,<br />
The inestimable &AElig;gis on her arm,<span class="lnm">540</span><br />
Immortal, unobnoxious to decay<br />
<span class="pgnm">047</span><a name="page_047" id="page_047"></a>
A hundred braids, close twisted, all of gold,<br />
Each valued at a hundred beeves,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_2-17">[17]</a> around<br />
Dependent fringed it. She from side to side<br />
Her eyes cerulean rolled, infusing thirst<span class="lnm">545</span><br />
Of battle endless into every breast.<br />
War won them now, war sweeter now to each<br />
Than gales to waft them over ocean home.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_2-18">[18]</a><br />
As when devouring flames some forest seize<br />
On the high mountains, splendid from afar<span class="lnm">550</span><br />
The blaze appears, so, moving on the plain,<br />
The steel-clad host innumerous flash'd to heaven.<br />
And as a multitude of fowls in flocks<br />
Assembled various, geese, or cranes, or swans<br />
Lithe-neck'd, long hovering o'er Ca&yuml;ster's banks<span class="lnm">555</span><br />
On wanton plumes, successive on the mead<br />
Alight at last, and with a clang so loud<br />
That all the hollow vale of Asius rings;<br />
In number such from ships and tents effused,<br />
They cover'd the Scamandrian plain; the earth<span class="lnm">560</span><br />
Rebellow'd to the feet of steeds and men.<br />
They overspread Scamander's grassy vale,<br />
Myriads, as leaves, or as the flowers of spring.<br />
As in the hovel where the peasant milks<br />
His kine in spring-time, when his pails are fill'd,<span class="lnm">565</span><br />
Thick clouds of humming insects on the wing<br />
Swarm all around him, so the Grecians swarm'd<br />
An unsumm'd multitude o'er all the plain,<br />
Bright arm'd, high crested, and athirst for war.<br />
As goat-herds separate their numerous flocks<span class="lnm">570</span><br />
With ease, though fed promiscuous, with like ease<br />

Stood Agamemnon "with an eye like Jove's,<br />

And with the port of Neptune. As the bull<br />
Conspicuous among all the herd appears,<br />

That day the son of Atreus, in the midst<br />
Of Heroes, eminent above them all.<span class="lnm">580</span></p>
<p>Tell me, (for ye are are heavenly, and beheld<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_2-20">[20]</a><br />
A scene, whereof the faint report alone<br />
Hath reached our ears, remote and ill-informed,)<br />
Tell me, ye Muses, under whom, beneath<br />
What Chiefs of royal or of humbler note<span class="lnm">585</span><br />
Stood forth the embattled Greeks? The host at large;<br />
<i>They</i> were a multitude in number more<br />
Than with ten tongues, and with ten mouths, each mouth<br />
Made vocal with a trumpet's throat of brass<br />
I might declare, unless the Olympian nine,<span class="lnm">590</span><br />

These in B&oelig;otia's fair and gallant fleet<br />
Of fifty ships, each bearing o'er the waves<br />
Thrice forty warriors, had arrived at Troy.</p>
<p>In thirty ships deep-laden with the brave,<br />
Aspledon and Orchomenos had sent<span class="lnm">620</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">050</span><a name="page_050" id="page_050"></a>
Their chosen youth; them ruled a noble pair,<br />
Sons of Astyoche; she, lovely nymph,<br />
Received by stealth, on Actor's stately roof,<br />
The embraces of a God, and bore to Mars<br />
Twins like himself, Ascalaphus the bold,<span class="lnm">625</span><br />
And bold I&auml;lmenus, expert in arms.</p>
<p>Beneath Epistrophus and Schedius, took<br />
Their destined station on B&oelig;otia's left,<br />
The brave Phocensians; they in forty ships<br />
From Cyparissus came, and from the rocks<span class="lnm">630</span><br />
Of Python, and from Crissa the divine;<br />
From Anemoria, Daulis, Panopeus,<br />
And from Hyampolis, and from the banks<br />
Of the Cephissus, sacred stream, and from<br />
Lil&aelig;a, seated at its fountain-head.<span class="lnm">635</span></p>
<p>Next from beyond Eub&oelig;a's happy isle<br />
In forty ships conveyed, stood forth well armed<br />
The Locrians; dwellers in Augeia some<br />
The pleasant, some of Opo&euml;is possessed,<br />
Some of Calliarus; these Scarpha sent,<span class="lnm">640</span><br />
And Cynus those; from Bessa came the rest,<br />
From Tarpha, Thronius, and from the brink<br />
Of loud Boagrius; Ajax them, the swift,<br />
Son of O&iuml;leus led, not such as he<br />
From Telamon, big-boned and lofty built,<span class="lnm">645</span><br />
But small of limb, and of an humbler crest;<br />
Yet he, competitor had none throughout<br />
The Grecians of what land soe'er, for skill<br />
In ushering to its mark the rapid lance.</p>
<p>Elphenor brought (Calchodon's mighty son)<span class="lnm">650</span><br />
The Eub&oelig;ans to the field. In forty ships<br />
From Histr&iuml;&aelig;a for her vintage famed,<br />
From Chalcis, from Iretria, from the gates<br />
Of maritime Cerinthus, from the heights<br />
Of Dios rock-built citadel sublime,<span class="lnm">655</span><br />
And from Caristus and from Styra came<br />
His warlike multitudes, all named alike<br />
Abantes, on whose shoulders fell behind<br />
<span class="pgnm">051</span><a name="page_051" id="page_051"></a>
Their locks profuse,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_2-23">[23]</a> and they were eager all<br />
To split the hauberk with the pointed spear.<span class="lnm">660</span></p>
<p>Nor Athens had withheld her generous sons,<br />
The people of Erectheus. Him of old<br />
The teeming glebe produced, a wondrous birth!<br />
And Pallas rear'd him: her own unctuous fane<br />
She made his habitation, where with bulls<span class="lnm">665</span><br />
The youth of Athens, and with slaughter'd lambs<br />
Her annual worship celebrate. Then led<br />
Menestheus, whom, (sage Nestor's self except,<br />
Thrice school'd in all events of human life,)<br />
None rivall'd ever in the just array<span class="lnm">670</span><br />
Of horse and man to battle. Fifty ships<br />
Black-prowed, had borne them to the distant war.</p>
<p>Ajax from Salamis twelve vessels brought,<br />
And where the Athenian band in phalanx stood<br />
Marshall'd compact, there station'd he his powers.<span class="lnm">675</span></p>
<p>The men of Argos and Tyrintha next,<br />
And of Hermione, that stands retired<br />

Of Epidaurus, crown'd with purple vines,<br />

Of sea-begirt &AElig;gina, and with thine,<br />
Maseta, and the dwellers on thy coast,<br />
Wave-worn E&iuml;on&aelig;; these all obeyed<br />
The dauntless Hero Diomede, whom served<br />
Sthenelus, son of Capaneus, a Chief<span class="lnm">685</span><br />
Of deathless fame, his second in command,<br />
And godlike man, Euryalus, the son<br />
Of King Mecisteus, Tala&uuml;s' son, his third.<br />
But Diomede controll'd them all, and him<br />
Twice forty sable ships their leader own'd.<span class="lnm">690</span></p>
<p>Came Agamemnon with a hundred ships,<br />
Exulting in his powers; more numerous they,<br />
<span class="pgnm">052</span><a name="page_052" id="page_052"></a>
And more illustrious far than other Chief<br />
Could boast, whoever. Clad in burnish'd brass,<br />
And conscious of pre-eminence, he stood.<span class="lnm">695</span><br />
He drew his host from cities far renown'd,<br />
Mycen&aelig;, and Corinthus, seat of wealth,<br />
Orneia, and Cleon&aelig; bulwark'd strong,<br />
And lovely Ar&aelig;thyria; Sicyon, where<br />
His seat of royal power held at the first<span class="lnm">700</span><br />
Adrastus: Hyperesia, and the heights<br />
Of Gono&euml;ssa; &AElig;gium, with the towns<br />
That sprinkle all that far-extended coast,<br />
Pellene also and wide Helice<br />
With all their shores, were number'd in his train.<span class="lnm">705</span></p>
<p>From hollow Laced&aelig;mon's glen profound,<br />
From Phare, Sparta, and from Messa, still<br />
Resounding with the ring-dove's amorous moan,<br />
From Brysia, from Augeia, from the rocks<br />
Of Laas, from Amycla, Otilus,<span class="lnm">710</span><br />
And from the towers of Helos, at whose foot<br />
The surf of Ocean falls, came sixty barks<br />
With Menelaus. From the monarch's host<br />
The royal brother ranged his own apart,<br />
and panted for revenge of Helen's wrongs,<span class="lnm">715</span><br />
And of her sighs and tears.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_2-24">[24]</a> From rank to rank,<br />
Conscious of dauntless might he pass'd, and sent<br />
Into all hearts the fervor of his own.</p>
<p>Gerenian Nestor in thrice thirty ships<br />
Had brought his warriors; they from Pylus came,<span class="lnm">720</span><br />
From blithe Arene, and from Thryos, built<br />
Fast by the fords of Alpheus, and from steep<br />
And stately &AElig;py. Their confederate powers<br />
Sent Amphigenia, Cyparissa veiled<br />
With broad redundance of funereal shades,<span class="lnm">725</span><br />
Pteleos and Helos, and of deathless fame<br />
Dorion. In Dorion erst the Muses met<br />
Thre&iuml;cian Thamyris, on his return<br />
<span class="pgnm">053</span><a name="page_053" id="page_053"></a>
From Eurytus, Oechalian Chief, and hush'd<br />
His song for ever; for he dared to vaunt<span class="lnm">730</span><br />
That he would pass in song even themselves<br />
The Muses, daughters of Jove &AElig;gis-arm'd.<br />
They therefore, by his boast incensed, the bard<br />
Struck blind, and from his memory dash'd severe<br />
All traces of his once celestial strains.<span class="lnm">735</span></p>
<p>Arcadia's sons, the dwellers at the foot<br />
Of mount Cyllene, where &AElig;pytus sleeps<br />
Intomb'd; a generation bold in fight,<br />
And warriors hand to hand; the valiant men<br />
Of Pheneus, of Orchomenos by flocks<span class="lnm">740</span><br />
Grazed numberless, of Ripe, Stratia, bleak<br />
Enispe; Mantinea city fair,<br />
Stymphelus and Parrhasia, and the youth<br />
Of Tegea; royal Agapenor these,<br />
Anc&aelig;us' offspring, had in sixty ships<span class="lnm">745</span><br />
To Troy conducted; numerous was the crew,<br />
And skilled in arms, which every vessel brought,<br />
And Agamemnon had with barks himself<br />
Supplied them, for, of inland realms possessed,<br />
They little heeded maritime employs.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_2-25">[25]</a><span class="lnm">750</span></p>
<p>The dwellers in Buprasium, on the shores<br />
Of pleasant Elis, and in all the land<br />
Myrsinus and the Hyrminian plain between,<br />
The rock Olenian, and the Alysian fount;<br />
These all obey'd four Chiefs, and galleys ten<span class="lnm">755</span><br />
Each Chief commanded, with Epeans filled.<br />
Amphimachus and Thalpius govern'd these,<br />
This, son of Cteatus, the other, sprung<br />
From Eurytus, and both of Actor's house.<br />
Diores, son of Amarynceus, those<span class="lnm">760</span><br />
Led on, and, for his godlike form renown'd,<br />
Polyxenus was Chieftain o'er the rest,<br />
Son of Agasthenes, Augeias' son.</p>
<p>Dulichium, and her sister sacred isles<br />
<span class="pgnm">054</span><a name="page_054" id="page_054"></a>
The Echinades, whose opposite aspect<span class="lnm">765</span><br />
Looks toward Elis o'er the curling waves,<br />
Sent forth their powers with Meges at their head,<br />
Brave son of Phyleus, warrior dear to Jove.<br />
Phyleus in wrath, his father's house renounced,<br />
And to Dulichium wandering, there abode.<span class="lnm">770</span><br />
Twice twenty ships had follow'd Meges forth.</p>
<p>Ulysses led the Cephallenians bold.<br />
From Ithaca, and from the lofty woods<br />
Of Neritus they came, and from the rocks<br />
Of rude &AElig;gilipa. Crocylia these,<span class="lnm">775</span><br />
And these Zacynthus own'd; nor yet a few<br />
From Samos, from Epirus join'd their aid,<br />
And from the opposite Ionian shore.<br />
Them, wise as Jove himself, Ulysses led<br />
In twelve fair ships, with crimson prows adorn'd.<span class="lnm">780</span></p>
<p>From forty ships, Thoas, Andr&aelig;mon's son,<br />
Had landed his &AElig;tolians; for extinct<br />
Was Meleager, and extinct the house<br />
Of Oeneus all, nor Oeneus self survived;<br />
To Thoas therefore had &AElig;tolia fallen;<span class="lnm">785</span><br />
Him Olenos, Pylene, Chalcis served,<br />
With Pleuro, and the rock-bound Calydon.</p>
<p>Idomeneus, spear-practised warrior, led<br />
The numerous Cretans. In twice forty ships<br />
He brought his powers to Troy. The warlike bands<span class="lnm">790</span><br />
Of Cnossus, of Gortyna wall'd around,<br />
Of Lyctus, of Lycastus chalky-white,<br />
Of Ph&aelig;stus, of Miletus, with the youth<br />
Of Rhytius him obey'd; nor these were all,<br />
But others from her hundred cities Crete<span class="lnm">795</span><br />
Sent forth, all whom Idomeneus the brave<br />
Commanded, with Meriones in arms<br />
Dread as the God of battles blood-imbrued.</p>
<p>Nine ships Tlepolemus, Herculean-born,<br />
For courage famed and for superior size,<span class="lnm">800</span><br />
Fill'd with his haughty Rhodians. They, in tribes<br />
Divided, dwelt distinct. Jelyssus these,<br />
<span class="pgnm">055</span><a name="page_055" id="page_055"></a>
Those Lindus, and the rest the shining soil<br />
Of white Camirus occupied. Him bore<br />
To Hercules, (what time he led the nymph<span class="lnm">805</span><br />
From Ephyre, and from Sellea's banks,<br />
After full many a city laid in dust.)<br />
Astyocheia. In his father's house<br />
Magnificent, Tlepolemus spear-famed<br />
Had scarce up-grown to manhood's lusty prime<span class="lnm">810</span><br />
When he his father's hoary uncle slew<br />
Lycimnius, branch of Mars. Then built he ships,<br />
And, pushing forth to sea, fled from the threats<br />
Of the whole house of Hercules. Huge toil<br />
And many woes he suffer'd, till at length<span class="lnm">815</span><br />
At Rhodes arriving, in three separate bands<br />
He spread himself abroad, Much was he loved<br />
Of all-commanding Jove, who bless'd him there,<br />
And shower'd abundant riches on them all.</p>
<p>Nireus of Syma, with three vessels came;<span class="lnm">820</span><br />
Nireus, Agl&aelig;a's offspring, whom she bore<br />
To Charopus the King; Nireus in form,<br />
(The faultless son of Peleus sole except,)<br />
Loveliest of all the Grecians call'd to Troy.<br />
But he was heartless and his men were few.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_2-26">[26]</a><span class="lnm">825</span></p>
<p>Nisyrus, Casus, Crapathus, and Cos<br />
Where reign'd Eurypylus, with all the isles<br />
Calydn&aelig; named, under two valiant Chiefs<br />
Their troops disposed; Phidippus one, and one,<br />
His brother Antiphus, begotten both<span class="lnm">830</span><br />
By Thessalus, whom Hercules begat.<br />
In thirty ships they sought the shores of Troy.</p>
<p>The warriors of Pelasgian Argos next,<br />
Of Alus, and Alope, and who held<br />
Trechina, Phthia, and for women fair<span class="lnm">835</span><br />
Distinguish'd, Hellas; known by various names<br />
Hellenes, Myrmidons, Ach&aelig;ans, them<br />
In fifty ships embark'd, Achilles ruled.<br />
<span class="pgnm">056</span><a name="page_056" id="page_056"></a>
But these were deaf to the hoarse-throated war,<br />
For there was none to draw their battle forth,<span class="lnm">840</span><br />
And give them just array. Close in his ships<br />
Achilles, after loss of the bright-hair'd<br />
Bris&euml;is, lay, resentful; her obtained<br />
Not without labor hard, and after sack<br />
Of Thebes and of Lyrnessus, where he slew<span class="lnm">845</span><br />
Two mighty Chiefs, sons of Evenus both,<br />
Epistrophus and Mynes, her he mourn'd,<br />
And for her sake self-prison'd in his fleet<br />
And idle lay, though soon to rise again.</p>
<p>From Phylace, and from the flowery fields<span class="lnm">850</span><br />
Of Pyrrhasus, a land to Ceres given<br />
By consecration, and from Iton green,<br />
Mother of flocks; from Antron by the sea,<br />
And from the grassy meads of Pteleus, came<br />
A people, whom while yet he lived, the brave<span class="lnm">855</span><br />
Protesila&uuml;s led; but him the earth<br />
Now cover'd dark and drear. A wife he left,<br />
To rend in Phylace her bleeding cheeks,<br />
And an unfinish'd mansion. First he died<br />
Of all the Greeks; for as he leap'd to land<span class="lnm">860</span><br />
Foremost by far, a Dardan struck him dead.<br />
Nor had his troops, though filled with deep regret,<br />
No leader; them Podarces led, a Chief<br />
Like Mars in battle, brother of the slain,<br />
But younger born, and from Iphiclus sprung<span class="lnm">865</span><br />
Who sprang from Phylacus the rich in flocks.<br />
But him Protesila&uuml;s, as in years,<br />
So also in desert of arms excell'd<br />
Heroic, whom his host, although they saw<br />
Podarces at their head, still justly mourn'd;<span class="lnm">870</span><br />
For he was fierce in battle, and at Troy<br />
With forty sable-sided ships arrived.</p>
<p>Eleven galleys, Pher&aelig; on the lake,<br />
And Boebe, and I&ouml;lchus, and the vale<br />
Of Glaphyr&aelig; supplied with crews robust<span class="lnm">875</span><br />
Under Eumelus; him Alcestis, praised<br />
<span class="pgnm">057</span><a name="page_057" id="page_057"></a>
For beauty above all her sisters fair,<br />
In Thessaly to King Admetus bore.</p>
<p>Methone, and Olizon's craggy coast,<br />
With Melib&oelig;a and Thaumasia sent<span class="lnm">880</span><br />
Seven ships; their rowers were good archers all,<br />
And every vessel dipped into the wave<br />
Her fifty oars. Them Philoctetes, skill'd<br />
To draw with sinewy arm the stubborn bow,<br />
Commanded; but he suffering anguish keen<span class="lnm">885</span><br />
Inflicted by a serpent's venom'd tooth,<br />
Lay sick in Lemnos; him the Grecians there<br />
Had left sore-wounded, but were destined soon<br />
To call to dear remembrance whom they left.<br />
Meantime, though sorrowing for his sake, his troops<span class="lnm">890</span><br />
Yet wanted not a chief; them Medon ruled,<br />
Whom Rhena to the far-famed conqueror bore<br />
O&iuml;leus, fruit of their unsanction'd loves.</p>
<p>From Tricca, from Ithome rough and rude<br />
With rocks and glens, and from Oechalia, town<span class="lnm">895</span><br />
Of Eurytus Oechalian-born, came forth<br />
Their warlike youth by Podalirius led<br />
And by Machaon, healers both expert<br />
Of all disease, and thirty ships were theirs.</p>
<p>The men of Ormenus, and from beside<span class="lnm">900</span><br />
The fountain Hypereia, from the tops<br />
Of chalky Titan, and Asteria's band;<br />
Them ruled Eurypylus, Ev&aelig;mon's son<br />
Illustrious, whom twice twenty ships obeyed.</p>
<p>Orthe, Gyrtone, Olo&ouml;sson white,<span class="lnm">905</span><br />
Argissa and Helone; they their youth<br />
Gave to control of Polyp&oelig;tes, son<br />
Undaunted of Piritho&uuml;s, son of Jove.<br />
Him, to Piritho&uuml;s, (on the self-same day<br />
When he the Centaurs punish'd and pursued<span class="lnm">910</span><br />
Sheer to &AElig;thic&aelig; driven from Pelion's heights<br />
The shaggy race) Hippodamia bore.<br />
Nor he alone them led. With him was join'd<br />
Leonteus dauntless warrior, from the bold<br />
<span class="pgnm">058</span><a name="page_058" id="page_058"></a>
Coronus sprung, who C&aelig;neus call'd his sire.<span class="lnm">915</span><br />
Twice twenty ships awaited their command.</p>
<p>Guneus from Cyphus twenty and two ships<br />
Led forth; the Enienes him obey'd,<br />
And the robust Per&oelig;bi, warriors bold,<br />
And dwellers on Dodona's wintry brow.<span class="lnm">920</span><br />
To these were join'd who till the pleasant fields<br />
Where Titaresius winds; the gentle flood<br />
Pours into Peneus all his limpid stores,<br />
But with the silver-eddied Peneus flows<br />
Unmixt as oil;<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_2-27">[27]</a> for Stygian is his stream,<span class="lnm">925</span><br />
And Styx is the inviolable oath.</p>
<p>Last with his forty ships, Tenthredon's son,<br />
The active Protho&uuml;s came. From the green banks<br />
Of Peneus his Magnesians far and near<br />
He gather'd, and from Pelion forest-crown'd.<span class="lnm">930</span></p>
<p>These were the princes and the Chiefs of Greece.<br />
Say, Muse, who most in personal desert<br />
Excell'd, and whose were the most warlike steeds<br />
And of the noblest strain. Their hue, their age,<br />
Their height the same, swift as the winds of heaven<span class="lnm">935</span><br />
And passing far all others, were the mares<br />
Which drew Eumelus; on Pierian hills<br />
The heavenly Archer of the silver bow,<br />
Apollo, bred them. But of men, the chief<br />
Was Telamonian Ajax, while wrath-bound<span class="lnm">940</span><br />
Achilles lay; for he was worthier far,<br />
And more illustrious were the steeds which bore<br />
The noble son of Peleus; but revenge<br />
On Agamemnon leader of the host<br />
Was all his thought, while in his gallant ships<span class="lnm">945</span><br />
Sharp-keel'd to cut the foaming flood, he lay.<br />
Meantime, along the margin of the deep<br />
His soldiers hurled the disk, or bent the bow.<br />
<span class="pgnm">059</span><a name="page_059" id="page_059"></a>
Or to its mark dispatch'd the quivering lance.<br />
Beside the chariots stood the unharness'd steeds<span class="lnm">950</span><br />
Cropping the lotus, or at leisure browsed<br />
On celery wild, from watery freshes gleaned.<br />
Beneath the shadow of the sheltering tent<br />
The chariot stood, while they, the charioteers<br />
Roam'd here and there the camp, their warlike lord<span class="lnm">955</span><br />
Regretting sad, and idle for his sake.</p>
<p>As if a fire had burnt along the ground,<br />
Such seem'd their march; earth groan'd their steps beneath;<br />
As when in Arimi, where fame reports<br />
Typho&euml;us stretch'd, the fires of angry Jove<span class="lnm">960</span><br />
Down darted, lash the ground, so groan'd the earth<br />
Beneath them, for they traversed swift the plain.</p>
<p>And now from Jove, with heavy tidings charged,<br />
Wind-footed Iris to the Trojans came.<br />
It was the time of council, when the throng<span class="lnm">965</span><br />
At Priam's gate assembled, young and old:<br />
Them, standing nigh, the messenger of heaven<br />
Accosted with the voice of Priam's son,<br />
Polites. He, confiding in his speed<br />
For sure deliverance, posted was abroad<span class="lnm">970</span><br />
On &AElig;syeta's tomb,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_2-28">[28]</a> intent to watch<br />
When the Achaian host should leave the fleet.<br />
The Goddess in his form thus them address'd.</p>
<p>Oh, ancient Monarch! Ever, evermore<br />
Speaking, debating, as if all were peace;<span class="lnm">975</span><br />
I have seen many a bright-embattled field,<br />
But never one so throng'd as this to-day.<br />
For like the leaves, or like the sands they come<br />
Swept by the winds, to gird the city round.</p>
<p>But Hector! chiefly thee I shall exhort.<span class="lnm">980</span><br />
In Priam's spacious city are allies<br />
<span class="pgnm">060</span><a name="page_060" id="page_060"></a>
Collected numerous, and of nations wide<br />
Disseminated various are the tongues.<br />
Let every Chief his proper troop command,<br />
And marshal his own citizens to war.<span class="lnm">985</span></p>
<p>She ceased; her Hector heard intelligent,<br />
And quick dissolved the council. All took arms.<br />
Wide flew the gates; forth rush'd the multitude,<br />
Horsemen and foot, and boisterous stir arose.<br />
In front of Ilium, distant on the plain,<span class="lnm">990</span><br />
Clear all around from all obstruction, stands<br />
An eminence high-raised, by mortal men<br />
Call'd Bateia, but the Gods the tomb<br />
Have named it of Myrinna swift in fight.<br />
Troy and her aids there set the battle forth.<span class="lnm">995</span></p>
<p>Huge Priameian Hector, fierce in arms,<br />
Led on the Trojans; with whom march'd the most<br />
And the most valiant, dexterous at the spear.</p>
<p>&AElig;neas, (on the hills of Ida him<br />
The lovely Venus to Anchises bore,<span class="lnm">1000</span><br />
A Goddess by a mortal man embraced)<br />
Led the Dardanians; but not he alone;<br />
Archilochus with him and Acamas<br />
Stood forth, the offspring of Antenor, each,<br />
And well instructed in all forms of war.<span class="lnm">1005</span></p>
<p>Fast by the foot of Ida, where they drank<br />
The limpid waters of &AElig;sepus, dwelt<br />
The Trojans of Zeleia. Rich were they<br />
And led by Pandarus, Lycaon's son,<br />
Whom Ph&oelig;bus self graced with the bow he bore.<span class="lnm">1010</span></p>
<p>Ap&aelig;sus, Adrastea, Terie steep,<br />
And Pitueia&mdash;them, Amphius clad<br />
In mail thick-woven, and Adrastus, ruled.<br />
They were the sons of the Percosian seer<br />
Merops, expert in the soothsayers' art<span class="lnm">1015</span><br />
Above all other; he his sons forbad<br />
The bloody fight, but disobedient they<br />
Still sought it, for their destiny prevailed.</p>
<p>The warriors of Percote, and who dwelt<br />
<span class="pgnm">061</span><a name="page_061" id="page_061"></a>
In Practius, in Arisba, city fair,<span class="lnm">1020</span><br />
In Sestus, in Abydus, march'd behind<br />
Princely Hyrtacides; his tawny steeds,<br />
Strong-built and tall, from Sellcentes' bank<br />
And from Arisba, had him borne to Troy.</p>
<p>Hippothous and Pilmus, branch of Mars,<span class="lnm">1025</span><br />
Both sons of Lethus the Pelasgian, they,<br />
Forth from Larissa for her fertile soil<br />
Far-famed, the spear-expert Pelasgians brought.</p>
<p>The Thracians (all whom Hellespont includes<br />
Within the banks of his swift-racing tide)<span class="lnm">1030</span><br />
Heroic Acamas and Pirous led.<br />
Euphemus, offspring of Tr&oelig;zenus, son<br />
Of Jove-protected Ceas, was the Chief<br />
Whom the spear-arm'd Ciconian band obey'd.</p>
<p>P&aelig;onia's archers follow'd to the field<span class="lnm">1035</span><br />
Pyr&aelig;chmes; they from Amydon remote<br />
Were drawn, where Axius winds; broad Axius, stream<br />
Diffused delightful over all the vale.</p>
<p>Pyl&aelig;menes, a Chief of giant might<br />
From the Eneti for forest-mules renowned<span class="lnm">1040</span><br />
March'd with his Paphlagonians; dwellers they<br />
In Sesamus and in Cytorus were,<br />
And by the stream Parthenius; Cromna these<br />
Sent forth, and those &AElig;gialus on the lip<br />
And margin of the land, and some, the heights<span class="lnm">1045</span><br />
Of Erythini, rugged and abrupt.</p>
<p>Epistrophus and Odius from the land<br />
Of Alybe, a region far remote,<br />
Where veins of silver wind, led to the field<br />
The Halizonians. With the Mysians came<span class="lnm">1050</span><br />
Chromis their Chief, and Ennomus; him skill'd<br />
In augury, but skill'd in vain, his art<br />
Saved not, but by &AElig;acides<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_2-29">[29]</a> the swift,<br />
With others in the Xanthus<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_2-30">[30]</a> slain, he died.<br />
<span class="pgnm">062</span><a name="page_062" id="page_062"></a>
Ascanius, lovely youth, and Phorcis, led<span class="lnm">1055</span><br />
The Phrygians from Ascania far remote,<br />
Ardent for battle. The M&oelig;onian race,<br />
(All those who at the foot of Tmolus dwelt,)<br />
Mesthles and Antiphus, fraternal pair,<br />
Sons of Pyl&aelig;menes commanded, both<span class="lnm">1060</span><br />
Of the Gyg&aelig;an lake in Lydia born.</p>
<p>Amphimachus and Nastes led to fight<br />
The Carians, people of a barbarous speech,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_2-31">[31]</a><br />
With the Milesians, and the mountain-race<br />
Of wood-crown'd Phthira, and who dwelt beside<span class="lnm">1065</span><br />
M&aelig;ander, or on Mycale sublime.<br />
Them led Amphimachus and Nastes, sons<br />
Renown'd of Nomion. Like a simple girl<br />
Came forth Amphimachus with gold bedight,<br />
But him his trappings from a woful death<span class="lnm">1070</span><br />
Saved not, when whirled beneath the bloody tide<br />
To Peleus' stormy son his spoils he left.</p>
<p>Sarpedon with the noble Glaucus led<br />
Their warriors forth from farthest Lycia, where<br />
Xanthus deep-dimpled rolls his oozy tide.<span class="lnm">1075</span></p>

<p class="outd">The armies meet. Paris throws out a challenge to the Grecian Princes.
Menelaus accepts it. The terms of the combat are adjusted solemnly by
Agamemnon on the part of Greece, and by Priam on the part of Troy.
The combat ensues, in which Paris is vanquished, whom yet Venus rescues.
Agamemnon demands from the Trojans a performance of the
covenant.</p>

<h3 class="chap">BOOK III.</h3>

<div class="poem">
<p class="noind"><a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_3-1">[1]</a>Now marshall'd all beneath their several chiefs,<br />
With deafening shouts, and with the clang of arms,<br />
The host of Troy advanced. Such clang is heard<br />
Along the skies, when from incessant showers<br />
Escaping, and from winter's cold, the cranes<span class="lnm">5</span><br />
Take wing, and over Ocean speed away;<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_3-2">[2]</a><br />
Wo to the land of dwarfs! prepared they fly<br />
For slaughter of the small Pygm&aelig;an race.<br />
Not so the Greeks; they breathing valor came,<br />
But silent all, and all with faithful hearts<span class="lnm">10</span><br />
On succor mutual to the last, resolved.<br />
As when the south wind wraps the mountain top<br />
In mist the shepherd's dread, but to the thief<br />
Than night itself more welcome, and the eye<br />
Is bounded in its ken to a stone's cast,<span class="lnm">15</span><br />
Such from beneath their footsteps dun and dense<br />
Uprose the dust, for swift they cross the plain.</p>
<p><span class="pgnm">066</span><a name="page_066" id="page_066"></a>
When, host to host opposed, full nigh they stood,<br />
Then Alexander<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_3-3">[3]</a> in the Trojan van<br />
Advanced was seen, all beauteous as a God;<span class="lnm">20</span><br />
His leopard's skin, his falchion and his bow<br />
Hung from his shoulder; bright with heads of brass<br />
He shook two spears, and challenged to the fight<br />
The bravest Argives there, defying all.<br />
Him, striding haughtily his host before<span class="lnm">25</span><br />
When Menelaus saw, such joy he felt<br />
As hunger-pinch'd the lion feels, by chance<br />
Conducted to some carcase huge, wild goat,<br />
Or antler'd stag; huntsmen and baying hounds<br />
Disturb not <i>him</i>, he gorges in their sight.<span class="lnm">30</span><br />
So Menelaus at the view rejoiced<br />
Of lovely Alexander, for he hoped<br />
His punishment at hand. At once, all armed,<br />
Down from his chariot to the ground he leap'd</p>
<p>When godlike Paris him in front beheld<span class="lnm">35</span><br />
Conspicuous, his heart smote him, and his fate<br />
Avoiding, far within the lines he shrank.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_3-4">[4]</a><br />
As one, who in some woodland height descrying<br />
A serpent huge, with sudden start recoils,<br />
His limbs shake under him; with cautious step<span class="lnm">40</span><br />
He slow retires; fear blanches cold his cheeks;<br />
So beauteous Alexander at the sight<br />
Of Atreus' son dishearten'd sore, the ranks<br />
Of haughty Trojans enter'd deep again:<br />
Him Hector eyed, and thus rebuked severe.<span class="lnm">45</span></p>
<p>Curst Paris! Fair deceiver! Woman-mad!<br />
I would to all in heaven that thou hadst died<br />
Unborn, at least unmated! happier far<br />
<span class="pgnm">067</span><a name="page_067" id="page_067"></a>
Than here to have incurr'd this public shame!<br />
Well may the Grecians taunt, and laughing loud,<span class="lnm">50</span><br />
Applaud the champion, slow indeed to fight<br />
And pusillanimous, but wondrous fair.<br />
Wast thou as timid, tell me, when with those<br />
Thy loved companions in that famed exploit,<br />
Thou didst consort with strangers, and convey<span class="lnm">55</span><br />
From distant lands a warrior's beauteous bride<br />
To be thy father's and his people's curse,<br />
Joy to our foes, but to thyself reproach?<br />
Behold her husband! Darest thou not to face<br />
The warlike prince? Now learn how brave a Chief<span class="lnm">60</span><br />
Thou hast defrauded of his blooming spouse.<br />
Thy lyre, thy locks, thy person, specious gifts<br />
Of partial Venus, will avail thee nought,<br />
Once mixt by Menelaus with the dust.<br />
But we are base ourselves, or long ago,<span class="lnm">65</span><br />
For all thy numerous mischiefs, thou hadst slept<br />
Secure beneath a coverlet<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_3-5">[5]</a> of stone.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_3-6">[6]</a></p>
<p>Then godlike Alexander thus replied.<br />
Oh Hector, true in temper as the axe<br />
Which in the shipwright's hand the naval plank<span class="lnm">70</span><br />
Divides resistless, doubling all his force,<br />
Such is thy dauntless spirit whose reproach<br />
Perforce I own, nor causeless nor unjust.<br />
Yet let the gracious gifts uncensured pass<br />
Of golden Venus; man may not reject<span class="lnm">75</span><br />
The glorious bounty by the Gods bestow'd,<br />
Nor follows their beneficence our choice.<br />
But if thy pleasure be that I engage<br />
With Menelaus in decision fierce<br />
Of desperate combat bid the host of Troy<span class="lnm">80</span><br />
And bid the Grecians sit; then face to face<br />
Commit us, in the vacant field between,<br />
To fight for Helen and for all her wealth.<br />
<span class="pgnm">068</span><a name="page_068" id="page_068"></a>
Who strongest proves, and conquers, he, of her<br />
And hers possess'd shall bear them safe away;<span class="lnm">85</span><br />
While ye (peace sworn and firm accord) shall dwell<br />
At Troy, and these to Argos shall return<br />
And to Achaia praised for women fair.</p>
<p>He ceased, whom Hector heard with joy; he moved<br />
Into the middle space, and with his spear<span class="lnm">90</span><br />
Advanced athwart push'd back the Trojan van,<br />
And all stood fast. Meantime at him the Greeks<br />
Discharged full volley, showering thick around<br />
From bow and sling;<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_3-7">[7]</a> when with a mighty voice<br />
Thus Agamemnon, leader of the host.<span class="lnm">95</span></p>
<p>Argives! Be still&mdash;shoot not, ye sons of Greece!<br />
Hector bespeaks attention. Hear the Chief!</p>
<p>He said, at once the Grecians ceased to shoot,<br />
And all sat silent. Hector then began.</p>
<p>Hear me, ye Trojans, and ye Greeks mail-arm'd,<span class="lnm">100</span><br />
While I shall publish in your ears the words<br />
Of Alexander, author of our strife.<br />
Trojans, he bids, and Grecians on the field<br />
Their arms dispose; while he, the hosts between,<br />
With warlike Menelaus shall in fight<span class="lnm">105</span><br />
Contend for Helen, and for all her wealth.<br />
Who strongest proves, and conquers, he, of her<br />
And hers possess'd, shall bear them safe away,<br />
And oaths of amity shall bind the rest.</p>
<p>He ceased, and all deep silence held, amazed;<span class="lnm">110</span><br />
When valiant Menelaus thus began.</p>
<p>Hear now me also, on whose aching heart<br />
These woes have heaviest fallen. At last I hope<br />
Decision near, Trojans and Greeks between,<br />
For ye have suffer'd in my quarrel much,<span class="lnm">115</span><br />
And much by Paris, author of the war.<br />
Die he who must, and peace be to the rest.<br />
But ye shall hither bring two lambs, one white,<br />
<span class="pgnm">069</span><a name="page_069" id="page_069"></a>
The other black;<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_3-8">[8]</a> this to the Earth devote,<br />
That to the Sun. We shall ourselves supply<span class="lnm">120</span><br />
A third for Jove. Then bring ye Priam forth,<br />
Himself to swear the covenant, (for his sons<br />
Are faithless) lest the oath of Jove be scorn'd.<br />
Young men are ever of unstable mind;<br />
But when an elder interferes, he views<span class="lnm">125</span><br />
Future and past together, and insures<br />
The compact, to both parties, uninfringed.</p>
<p>So Menelaus spake; and in all hearts<br />
Awaken'd joyful hope that there should end<br />
War's long calamities. Alighted each,<span class="lnm">130</span><br />
And drew his steeds into the lines. The field<br />
Glitter'd with arms put off, and side by side,<br />
Ranged orderly, while the interrupted war<br />
Stood front to front, small interval between.</p>
<p>Then Hector to the city sent in haste<span class="lnm">135</span><br />
Two heralds for the lambs, and to invite<br />
Priam; while Agamemnon, royal Chief,<br />
Talthybius to the Grecian fleet dismiss'd<br />
For a third lamb to Jove; nor he the voice<br />
Of noble Agamemnon disobey'd.<span class="lnm">140</span></p>
<p>Iris, ambassadress of heaven, the while,<br />
To Helen came. La&ouml;dice she seem'd,<br />
Loveliest of all the daughters of the house<br />
Of Priam, wedded to Antenor's son,<br />
King Helic&auml;on. Her she found within,<span class="lnm">145</span><br />
An ample web magnificent she wove,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_3-9">[9]</a><br />
Inwrought with numerous conflicts for her sake<br />
Beneath the hands of Mars endured by Greeks<br />
Mail-arm'd, and Trojans of equestrian fame.<br />
<span class="pgnm">070</span><a name="page_070" id="page_070"></a>
Swift Iris, at her side, her thus address'd.<span class="lnm">150</span></p>
<p>Haste, dearest nymph! a wondrous sight behold!<br />
Greeks brazen-mail'd, and Trojans steed-renown'd.<br />
So lately on the cruel work of Mars<br />
Intent and hot for mutual havoc, sit<br />
Silent; the war hath paused, and on his shield<span class="lnm">155</span><br />
Each leans, his long spear planted at his side.<br />
Paris and Menelaus, warrior bold,<br />
With quivering lances shall contend for thee,<br />
And thou art his who conquers; his for ever.</p>
<p>So saying, the Goddess into Helen's soul<span class="lnm">160</span><br />
Sweetest desire infused to see again<br />
Her former Lord, her parents, and her home.<br />
At once o'ermantled with her snowy veil<br />
She started forth, and as she went let fall<br />
A tender tear; not unaccompanied<span class="lnm">165</span><br />
She went, but by two maidens of her train<br />
Attended, &AElig;thra, Pittheus' daughter fair,<br />
And soft-eyed Clymene. Their hasty steps<br />
Convey'd them quickly to the Sc&aelig;an gate.<br />
There Priam, Panthous, Clytius, Lampus sat,<span class="lnm">170</span><br />
Thymoetes, Hicetaon, branch of Mars,<br />
Antenor and Ucalegon the wise,<br />
All, elders of the people; warriors erst,<br />
But idle now through age, yet of a voice<br />
Still indefatigable as the fly's<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_3-10">[10]</a><span class="lnm">175</span><br />
Which perch'd among the boughs sends forth at noon<br />
Through all the grove his slender ditty sweet.<br />
Such sat those Trojan leaders on the tower,<br />
Who, soon as Helen on the steps they saw,<br />
In accents quick, but whisper'd, thus remark'd.<span class="lnm">180</span></p>
<p>Trojans and Grecians wage, with fair excuse,<br />
Long war for so much beauty.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_3-11">[11]</a> Oh, how like<br />
In feature to the Goddesses above!<br />
<span class="pgnm">071</span><a name="page_071" id="page_071"></a>
Pernicious loveliness! Ah, hence away,<br />
Resistless as thou art and all divine,<span class="lnm">185</span><br />
Nor leave a curse to us, and to our sons.</p>
<p>So they among themselves; but Priam call'd<br />
Fair Helen to his side.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_3-12">[12]</a> My daughter dear!<br />
Come, sit beside me. Thou shalt hence discern<br />
Thy former Lord, thy kindred and thy friends.<span class="lnm">190</span><br />
I charge no blame on thee. The Gods have caused,<br />
Not thou, this lamentable war to Troy.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_3-13">[13]</a><br />
Name to me yon Achaian Chief for bulk<br />
Conspicuous, and for port. Taller indeed<br />
I may perceive than he; but with these eyes<span class="lnm">195</span><br />
Saw never yet such dignity, and grace.<br />
Declare his name. Some royal Chief he seems.</p>
<p>To whom thus Helen, loveliest of her sex,<br />
My other Sire! by me for ever held<br />
In reverence, and with filial fear beloved!<span class="lnm">200</span><br />
Oh that some cruel death had been my choice,<br />
Rather than to abandon, as I did,<br />
All joys domestic, matrimonial bliss,<br />
Brethren, dear daughter, and companions dear,<br />
A wanderer with thy son. Yet I alas!<span class="lnm">205</span><br />
Died not, and therefore now, live but to weep.<br />
But I resolve thee. Thou behold'st the son<br />
<span class="pgnm">072</span><a name="page_072" id="page_072"></a>
Of Atreus, Agamemnon, mighty king,<br />
In arms heroic, gracious in the throne,<br />
And, (though it shame me now to call him such,)<span class="lnm">210</span><br />
By nuptial ties a brother once to me.</p>
<p>Then him the ancient King-admiring, said.<br />
Oh blest Atrides, happy was thy birth,<br />
And thy lot glorious, whom this gallant host<br />
So numerous, of the sons of Greece obey!<span class="lnm">215</span><br />
To vine-famed Phrygia, in my days of youth,<br />
I journey'd; many Phrygians there I saw,<br />
Brave horsemen, and expert; they were the powers<br />
Of Otreus and of Mygdon, godlike Chief,<br />
And on the banks of Sangar's stream encamp'd.<span class="lnm">220</span><br />
I march'd among them, chosen in that war<br />
Ally of Phrygia, and it was her day<br />
Of conflict with the man-defying race,<br />
The Amazons; yet multitudes like these<br />
Thy bright-eyed Greeks, I saw not even there.<span class="lnm">225</span></p>
<p>The venerable King observing next<br />
Ulysses, thus inquired. My child, declare<br />
Him also. Shorter by the head he seems<br />
Than Agamemnon, Atreus' mighty son,<br />
But shoulder'd broader, and of ampler chest;<span class="lnm">230</span><br />
He hath disposed his armor on the plain,<br />
But like a ram, himself the warrior ranks<br />
Ranges majestic; like a ram full-fleeced<br />
By numerous sheep encompass'd snowy-white.</p>
<p>To whom Jove's daughter Helen thus replied.<span class="lnm">235</span><br />
In him the son of old La&euml;rtes know,<br />
Ulysses; born in Ithaca the rude,<br />
But of a piercing wit, and deeply wise.</p>
<p>Then answer thus, Antenor sage return'd.<br />
Princess thou hast described him: hither once<span class="lnm">240</span><br />
The noble Ithacan, on thy behalf<br />
Ambassador with Menelaus, came:<br />
Beneath my roof, with hospitable fare<br />
Friendly I entertained them. Seeing then<br />
Occasion opportune, I closely mark'd<span class="lnm">245</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">073</span><a name="page_073" id="page_073"></a>
The genius and the talents of the Chiefs,<br />
And this I noted well; that when they stood<br />
Amid the assembled counsellors of Troy,<br />
Then Menelaus his advantage show'd,<br />
Who by the shoulders overtopp'd his friend.<span class="lnm">250</span><br />
But when both sat, Ulysses in his air<br />
Had more of state and dignity than he.<br />
In the delivery of a speech address'd<br />
To the full senate, Menelaus used<br />
Few words, but to the matter, fitly ranged,<span class="lnm">255</span><br />
And with much sweetness utter'd; for in loose<br />
And idle play of ostentatious terms<br />
He dealt not, thhugh he were the younger man.<br />
But when the wise Ulysses from his seat<br />
Had once arisen, he would his downcast eyes<span class="lnm">260</span><br />
So rivet on the earth, and with a hand<br />
That seem'd untutor'd in its use, so hold<br />
His sceptre, swaying it to neither side,<br />
That hadst thou seen him, thou hadst thought him, sure,<br />
Some chafed and angry idiot, passion-fixt.<span class="lnm">265</span><br />
Yet, when at length, the clear and mellow base<br />
Of his deep voice brake forth, and he let fall<br />
His chosen words like flakes of feather'd snow,<br />
None then might match Ulysses; leisure, then,<br />
Found none to wonder at his noble form.<span class="lnm">270</span></p>
<p>The third of whom the venerable king<br />
Inquired, was Ajax.&mdash;Yon Achaian tall,<br />
Whose head and shoulders tower above the rest,<br />
And of such bulk prodigious&mdash;who is he?</p>
<p>Him answer'd Helen, loveliest of her sex.<span class="lnm">275</span><br />
A bulwark of the Greeks. In him thou seest<br />
Gigantic Ajax. Opposite appear<br />
The Cretans, and among the Chiefs of Crete<br />
stands, like a God, Idomeneus. Him oft<br />
From Crete arrived, was Menela&uuml;s wont<span class="lnm">280</span><br />
To entertain; and others now I see,<br />
Achaians, whom I could recall to mind,<br />
And give to each his name; but two brave youths<br />
<span class="pgnm">074</span><a name="page_074" id="page_074"></a>
I yet discern not; for equestrian skill<br />
One famed, and one a boxer never foiled;<span class="lnm">285</span><br />
My brothers; born of Leda; sons of Jove;<br />
Castor and Pollux. Either they abide<br />
In lovely Sparta still, or if they came,<br />
Decline the fight, by my disgrace abash'd<br />
And the reproaches which have fallen on me.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_3-14">[14]</a><span class="lnm">290</span></p>
<p>She said; but they already slept inhumed<br />
In Lacedemon, in their native soil.</p>
<p>And now the heralds, through the streets of Troy<br />
Charged with the lambs, and with a goat-skin filled<br />
With heart-exhilarating wine prepared<span class="lnm">295</span><br />
For that divine solemnity, return'd.<br />
Id&aelig;us in his hand a beaker bore<br />
Resplendent, with its fellow cups of gold,<br />
And thus he summon'd ancient Priam forth.</p>
<p>Son of La&ouml;medon, arise. The Chiefs<span class="lnm">300</span><br />
Call thee, the Chiefs of Ilium and of Greece.<br />
Descend into the plain. We strike a truce,<br />
And need thine oath to bind it. Paris fights<br />
With warlike Menela&uuml;s for his spouse;<br />
Their spears decide the strife. The conqueror wins<span class="lnm">305</span><br />
Helen and all her treasures. We, thenceforth,<br />
(Peace sworn and amity) shall dwell secure<br />
In Troy, while they to Argos shall return<br />
And to Achaia praised for women fair.</p>
<p>He spake, and Priam, shuddering, bade his train<span class="lnm">310</span><br />
Prepare his steeds; they sedulous obey'd.<br />
First, Priam mounting, backward stretch'd the reins;<br />
Antenor, next, beside him sat, and through<br />
The Sc&aelig;an gate they drove into the plain.<br />
Arriving at the hosts of Greece and Troy<span class="lnm">315</span><br />
They left the chariot, and proceeded both<br />
Into the interval between the hosts.<br />
<span class="pgnm">075</span><a name="page_075" id="page_075"></a>
Then uprose Agamemnon, and uprose<br />
All-wise Ulysses. Next, the heralds came<br />
Conspicuous forward, expediting each<span class="lnm">320</span><br />
The ceremonial; they the beaker fill'd<br />
With wine, and to the hands of all the kings<br />
Minister'd water. Agamemnon then<br />
Drawing his dagger which he ever bore<br />
Appendant to his heavy falchion's sheath,<span class="lnm">325</span><br />
Cut off the forelocks of the lambs,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_3-15">[15]</a> of which<br />
The heralds gave to every Grecian Chief<br />
A portion, and to all the Chiefs of Troy.<br />
Then Agamemnon raised his hands, and pray'd.</p>
<p>Jove, Father, who from Ida stretchest forth<span class="lnm">330</span><br />
Thine arm omnipotent, o'erruling all,<br />
And thou, all-seeing and all-hearing Sun,<br />
Ye Rivers, and thou conscious Earth, and ye<br />
Who under earth on human kind avenge<br />
Severe, the guilt of violated oaths,<span class="lnm">335</span><br />
Hear ye, and ratify what now we swear!<br />
Should Paris slay the hero amber-hair'd,<br />
My brother Menela&uuml;s, Helen's wealth<br />
And Helen's self are his, and all our host<br />
Shall home return to Greece; but should it chance<span class="lnm">340</span><br />
That Paris fall by Menela&uuml;s' hand,<br />
Then Troy shall render back what she detains,<br />
With such amercement as is meet, a sum<br />
To be remember'd in all future times.<br />
Which penalty should Priam and his sons<span class="lnm">345</span><br />
Not pay, though Paris fall, then here in arms<br />
I will contend for payment of the mulct<br />
My due, till, satisfied, I close the war.</p>
<p>He said, and with his ruthless steel the lambs<br />
Stretch'd panting all, but soon they ceased to pant,<span class="lnm">350</span><br />
For mortal was the stroke.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_3-16">[16]</a> Then drawing forth<br />
<span class="pgnm">076</span><a name="page_076" id="page_076"></a>
Wine from the beaker, they with brimming cups<br />
Hail'd the immortal Gods, and pray'd again,<br />
And many a Grecian thus and Trojan spake.</p>
<p>All-glorious Jove, and ye the powers of heaven,<span class="lnm">355</span><br />
Whoso shall violate this contract first,<br />
So be the brains of them and of their sons<br />
Pour'd out, as we this wine pour on the earth,<br />
And may their wives bring forth to other men!</p>
<p>So they: but them Jove heard not. Then arose<span class="lnm">360</span><br />
Priam, the son of Dardanus, and said,</p>
<p>Hear me, ye Trojans and ye Greeks well-arm'd.<br />
Hence back to wind-swept Ilium I return,<br />
Unable to sustain the sight, my son<br />
With warlike Menela&uuml;s match'd in arms.<span class="lnm">365</span><br />
Jove knows, and the immortal Gods, to whom<br />
Of both, this day is preordain'd the last.</p>
<p>So spake the godlike monarch, and disposed<br />
Within the royal chariot all the lambs;<br />
Then, mounting, check'd the reins; Antenor next<span class="lnm">370</span><br />
Ascended, and to Ilium both return'd.</p>
<p>First, Hector and Ulysses, noble Chief,<br />
Measured the ground; then taking lots for proof<br />
Who of the combatants should foremost hurl<br />
His spear, they shook them in a brazen casque;<span class="lnm">375</span><br />
Meantime the people raised their hands on high,<br />
And many a Grecian thus and Trojan prayed.</p>
<p>Jove, Father, who on Ida seated, seest<br />
And rulest all below, glorious in power!<br />
Of these two champions, to the drear abodes<span class="lnm">380</span><br />
Of Ades him appoint who furnish'd first<br />
The cause of strife between them, and let peace<br />
Oath-bound, and amity unite the rest!</p>
<p>So spake the hosts; then Hector shook the lots,<br />
Majestic Chief, turning his face aside.<span class="lnm">385</span><br />
Forth sprang the lot of Paris. They in ranks<br />
Sat all, where stood the fiery steeds of each,<br />
And where his radiant arms lay on the field.<br />
Illustrious Alexander his bright arms<br />
<span class="pgnm">077</span><a name="page_077" id="page_077"></a>
Put on, fair Helen's paramour. <a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_3-17">[17]</a>He clasp'd<span class="lnm">390</span><br />
His polish'd greaves with silver studs secured;<br />
His brother's corselet to his breast he bound,<br />
Lycaon's, apt to his own shape and size,<br />
And slung athwart his shoulders, bright emboss'd,<br />
His brazen sword; his massy buckler broad<span class="lnm">395</span><br />
He took, and to his graceful head his casque<br />
Adjusted elegant, which, as he moved,<br />
Its bushy crest waved dreadful; last he seized,<br />
Well fitted to his gripe, his ponderous spear.<br />
Meantime the hero Menela&uuml;s made<span class="lnm">400</span><br />
Like preparation, and his arms put on.</p>
<p>When thus, from all the multitude apart,<br />
Both combatants had arm'd, with eyes that flash'd<br />
Defiance, to the middle space they strode,<br />
Trojans and Greeks between. Astonishment<span class="lnm">405</span><br />
Seized all beholders. On the measured ground<br />
Full near they stood, each brandishing on high<br />
His massy spear, and each was fiery wroth.</p>
<p>First, Alexander his long-shadow'd spear<br />
Sent forth, and on his smooth shield's surface struck<span class="lnm">410</span><br />
The son of Atreus, but the brazen guard<br />
Pierced not, for at the disk, with blunted point<br />
Reflex, his ineffectual weapon stay'd.<br />
<span class="pgnm">078</span><a name="page_078" id="page_078"></a>
Then Menela&uuml;s to the fight advanced<br />
Impetuous, after prayer offer'd to Jove.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_3-18">[18]</a><span class="lnm">415</span></p>
<p>King over all! now grant me to avenge<br />
My wrongs on Alexander; now subdue<br />
The aggressor under me; that men unborn<br />
May shudder at the thought of faith abused,<br />
And hospitality with rape repaid.<span class="lnm">420</span><br />
He said, and brandishing his massy spear,<br />
Dismiss'd it. Through the burnish'd buckler broad<br />
Of Priam's son the stormy weapon flew,<br />
Transpierced his costly hauberk, and the vest<br />
Ripp'd on his flank; but with a sideward bend<span class="lnm">425</span><br />
He baffled it, and baulk'd the dreadful death.</p>
<p>Then Menela&uuml;s drawing his bright blade,<br />
Swung it aloft, and on the hairy crest<br />
Smote him; but shiver'd into fragments small<br />
The falchion at the stroke fell from his hand.<span class="lnm">430</span><br />
Vexation fill'd him; to the spacious heavens<br />
He look'd, and with a voice of wo exclaim'd&mdash;</p>
<p>Jupiter! of all powers by man adored<br />
To me most adverse! Confident I hoped<br />
Revenge for Paris' treason, but my sword<span class="lnm">435</span><br />
Is shivered, and I sped my spear in vain.</p>
<p>So saying, he sprang on him, and his long crest<br />
Seized fast; then, turning, drew him by that hold<br />
Toward the Grecian host. The broider'd band<br />
That underbraced his helmet at the chin,<span class="lnm">440</span><br />
Strain'd to his smooth neck with a ceaseless force,<br />
Chok'd him; and now had Menelaus won<br />
Deathless renown, dragging him off the field,<br />
But Venus, foam-sprung Goddess, feeling quick<br />
His peril imminent, snapp'd short the brace<span class="lnm">445</span><br />
Though stubborn, by a slaughter'd<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_3-19">[19]</a> ox supplied,<br />
And the void helmet follow'd as he pull'd.<br />
<span class="pgnm">079</span><a name="page_079" id="page_079"></a>
That prize the Hero, whirling it aloft,<br />
Threw to his Greeks, who caught it and secured,<br />
Then with vindictive strides he rush'd again<span class="lnm">450</span><br />
On Paris, spear in hand; but him involved<br />
In mist opaque Venus with ease divine<br />
Snatch'd thence, and in his chamber placed him, fill'd<br />
With scents odorous, spirit-soothing sweets.<br />
Nor stay'd the Goddess, but at once in quest<span class="lnm">455</span><br />
Of Helen went; her on a lofty tower<br />
She found, where many a damsel stood of Troy,<br />
And twitch'd her fragrant robe. In form she seem'd<br />
An ancient matron, who, while Helen dwelt<br />
In Laced&aelig;mon, her unsullied wool<span class="lnm">460</span><br />
Dress'd for her, faithfullest of all her train.<br />
Like her disguised the Goddess thus began.</p>
<p>Haste&mdash;Paris calls thee&mdash;on his sculptured couch,<br />
(Sparkling alike his looks and his attire)<br />
He waits thy wish'd return. Thou wouldst not dream<span class="lnm">465</span><br />
That he had fought; he rather seems prepared<br />
For dance, or after dance, for soft repose.</p>
<p>So saying, she tumult raised in Helen's mind.<br />
Yet soon as by her symmetry of neck,<br />
By her love-kindling breasts and luminous eyes<span class="lnm">470</span><br />
She knew the Goddess, her she thus bespake.</p>
<p>Ah whence, deceitful deity! thy wish<br />
Now to ensnare me? Wouldst thou lure me, say,<br />
To some fair city of M&aelig;onian name<br />
Or Phrygian, more remote from Sparta still?<span class="lnm">475</span><br />
Hast thou some human favorite also there?<br />
Is it because Atrides hath prevailed<br />
To vanquish Paris, and would bear me home<br />
Unworthy as I am, that thou attempt'st<br />
Again to cheat me? Go thyself&mdash;sit thou<span class="lnm">480</span><br />
Beside him&mdash;for his sake renounce the skies;<br />
Watch him, weep for him; till at length his wife<br />
He deign to make thee, or perchance his slave.<br />
I go not (now to go were shame indeed)<br />
To dress his couch; nor will I be the jest<span class="lnm">485</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">080</span><a name="page_080" id="page_080"></a>
Of all my sex in Ilium. Oh! my griefs<br />
Are infinite, and more than I can bear.</p>
<p>To whom, the foam-sprung Goddess, thus incensed.<br />
Ah wretch! provoke not me; lest in my wrath<br />
Abandoning thee, I not hate thee less<span class="lnm">490</span><br />
Than now I fondly love thee, and beget<br />
Such detestation of thee in all hearts,<br />
Grecian and Trojan, that thou die abhorr'd.</p>
<p>The Goddess ceased. Jove's daughter, Helen, fear'd,<br />
And, in her lucid veil close wrapt around,<span class="lnm">495</span><br />
Silent retired, of all those Trojan dames<br />
Unseen, and Venus led, herself, the way.<br />
Soon then as Alexander's fair abode<br />
They reach'd, her maidens quick their tasks resumed,<br />
And she to her own chamber lofty-roof'd<span class="lnm">500</span><br />
Ascended, loveliest of her sex. A seat<br />
For Helen, daughter of Jove &AElig;gis-arm'd,<br />
To Paris opposite, the Queen of smiles<br />
Herself disposed; but with averted eyes<br />
She sat before him, and him keen reproach'd.<span class="lnm">505</span></p>
<p>Thou hast escaped.&mdash;Ah would that thou hadst died<br />
By that heroic arm, mine husband's erst!<br />
Thou once didst vaunt thee in address and strength<br />
Superior. Go then&mdash;challenge yet again<br />
The warlike Menela&uuml;s forth in fight.<span class="lnm">510</span><br />
But hold. The hero of the amber locks<br />
Provoke no more so rashly, lest the point<br />
Of his victorious spear soon stretch thee dead.</p>
<p>She ended, to whom Paris thus replied.<br />
Ah Helen, wound me not with taunt severe!<span class="lnm">515</span><br />
Me, Menela&uuml;s, by Minerva's aid,<br />
Hath vanquish'd now, who may hereafter, him.<br />
We also have our Gods. But let us love.<br />
For never since the day when thee I bore<br />
From pleasant Laced&aelig;mon o'er the waves<span class="lnm">520</span><br />
To Cran&auml;e's fair isle, and first enjoy'd<br />
Thy beauty, loved I as I love thee now,<br />
Or felt such sweetness of intense desire.</p>
<p><span class="pgnm">081</span><a name="page_081" id="page_081"></a>
He spake, and sought his bed, whom follow'd soon<br />
Jove's daughter, reconciled to his embrace.<span class="lnm">525</span></p>
<p>But Menela&uuml;s like a lion ranged<br />
The multitude, inquiring far and near<br />
For Paris lost. Yet neither Trojan him<br />
Nor friend of Troy could show, whom, else, through love<br />
None had conceal'd, for him as death itself<span class="lnm">530</span><br />
All hated, but his going none had seen.</p>
<p>Amidst them all then spake the King of men.<br />
Trojans, and Dardans, and allies of Troy!<br />
The warlike Menela&uuml;s hath prevailed,<br />
As is most plain. Now therefore bring ye forth<span class="lnm">535</span><br />
Helen with all her treasures, also bring<br />
Such large amercement as is meet, a sum<br />
To be remember'd in all future times.</p>
<p>So spake Atrides, and Achaia's host<br />
With loud applause confirm'd the monarch's claim.<span class="lnm">540</span></p>

<h3 class="chap">ARGUMENT OF THE FOURTH BOOK.</h3>

<p class="outd">In a Council of the Gods, a dispute arises between Jupiter and Juno,
which is at last compromised, Jove consenting to dispatch Minerva with
a charge to incite some Trojan to a violation of the truce. Minerva descends
for that purpose, and in the form of Laodocus, a son of Priam,
exhorts Pandarus to shoot at Menelaus, and succeeds. Menelaus is
wounded, and Agamemnon having consigned him to the care of Machaon,
goes forth to perform the duties of commander-in-chief, in the encouragement
of his host to battle. The battle begins.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="noind">Now, on the golden floor of Jove's abode<br />
The Gods all sat consulting; Hebe them,<br />
Graceful, with nectar served;<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_4-1">[1]</a> they pledging each<br />
His next, alternate quaff'd from cups of gold,<br />
And at their ease reclined, look'd down on Troy,<span class="lnm">5</span><br />
When, sudden, Jove essay'd by piercing speech<br />
Invidious, to enkindle Juno's ire.</p>
<p>Two Goddesses on Menelaus' part<br />
Confederate stand, Juno in Argos known,<br />
Pallas in Alalcomene;<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_4-2">[2]</a> yet they<span class="lnm">10</span><br />
Sequester'd sit, look on, and are amused.<br />
Not so smile-loving Venus; she, beside<br />
Her champion station'd, saves him from his fate,<br />
And at this moment, by her aid, he lives.<br />
But now, since victory hath proved the lot<span class="lnm">15</span><br />
Of warlike Menelaus, weigh ye well<br />
The matter; shall we yet the ruinous strife<br />
Prolong between the nations, or consent<br />
To give them peace? should peace your preference win,<br />
And prove alike acceptable to all,<span class="lnm">20</span><br />
Stand Ilium, and let Menelaus bear<br />
Helen of Argos back to Greece again.</p>
<p><span class="pgnm">086</span><a name="page_086" id="page_086"></a>
He ended; Juno and Minerva heard,<br />
Low-murmuring deep disgust; for side by side<br />
They forging sat calamity to Troy.<span class="lnm">25</span><br />
Minerva through displeasure against Jove<br />
Nought utter'd, for with rage her bosom boil'd;<br />
But Juno check'd not hers, who thus replied.</p>
<p>What word hath pass'd thy lips, Jove most severe!<br />
How? wouldst thou render fruitless all my pains?<span class="lnm">30</span><br />
The sweat that I have pour'd? my steeds themselves<br />
Have fainted while I gather'd Greece in arms<br />
For punishment of Priam and his sons.<br />
Do it. But small thy praise shall be in heaven.</p>
<p>Then her the Thunderer answer'd sore displeased.<span class="lnm">35</span><br />
Ah shameless! how have Priam and his sons<br />
So much transgress'd against thee, that thou burn'st<br />
With ceaseless rage to ruin populous Troy?<br />
Go, make thine entrance at her lofty gates,<br />
Priam and all his house, and all his host<span class="lnm">40</span><br />
Alive devour; then, haply, thou wilt rest;<br />
Do even as thou wilt, that this dispute<br />
Live not between us a consuming fire<br />
For ever. But attend; mark well the word.<br />
When I shall also doom in future time<span class="lnm">45</span><br />
Some city to destruction, dear to thee,<br />
Oppose me not, but give my fury way<br />
As I give way to thine, not pleased myself,<br />
Yet not unsatisfied, so thou be pleased.<br />
For of all cities of the sons of men,<span class="lnm">50</span><br />
And which the sun and stars from heaven behold,<br />
Me sacred Troy most pleases, Priam me<br />
Most, and the people of the warrior King.<br />
Nor without cause. They feed mine altar well;<br />
Libation there, and steam of savory scent<span class="lnm">55</span><br />
Fail not, the tribute which by lot is ours.</p>
<p>Him answer'd, then, the Goddess ample-eyed,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_4-3">[3]</a><br />
Majestic Juno: Three fair cities me,<br />
<span class="pgnm">087</span><a name="page_087" id="page_087"></a>
Of all the earth, most interest and engage,<br />
Mycen&aelig; for magnificence renown'd,<span class="lnm">60</span><br />
Argos, and Sparta. Them, when next thy wrath<br />
Shall be inflamed against them, lay thou waste;<br />
I will not interpose on their behalf;<br />
Thou shalt not hear me murmur; what avail<br />
Complaint or force against thy matchless arm?<span class="lnm">65</span><br />
Yet were it most unmeet that even I<br />
Should toil in vain; I also boast a birth<br />
Celestial; Saturn deeply wise, thy Sire,<br />
Is also mine; our origin is one.<br />
Thee I acknowledge Sovereign, yet account<span class="lnm">70</span><br />
Myself entitled by a twofold claim<br />
To veneration both from Gods and men,<br />
The daughter of Jove's sire, and spouse of Jove.<br />
Concession mutual therefore both thyself<br />
Befits and me, whom when the Gods perceive<span class="lnm">75</span><br />
Disposed to peace, they also shall accord.<br />
Come then.&mdash;To yon dread field dispatch in haste<br />
Minerva, with command that she incite<br />
The Trojans first to violate their oath<br />
By some fresh insult on the exulting Greeks.<span class="lnm">80</span></p>
<p>So Juno; nor the sire of all refused,<br />
But in wing'd accents thus to Pallas spake.</p>
<p>Begone; swift fly to yonder field; incite<br />
The Trojans first to violate their oath<br />
By some fresh insult on the exulting Greeks.<span class="lnm">85</span></p>
<p>The Goddess heard, and what she wish'd, enjoin'd,<br />
Down-darted swift from the Olympian heights,<br />
In form a meteor, such as from his hand<br />
Not seldom Jove dismisses, beaming bright<br />
And breaking into stars, an omen sent<span class="lnm">90</span><br />
To mariners, or to some numerous host.<br />
Such Pallas seem'd, and swift descending, dropp'd<br />
Full in the midst between them. They with awe<br />
That sign portentous and with wonder view'd,<br />
Achaians both and Trojans, and his next<span class="lnm">95</span><br />
The soldier thus bespake. Now either war<br />
<span class="pgnm">088</span><a name="page_088" id="page_088"></a>
And dire hostility again shall flame,<br />
Or Jove now gives us peace. Both are from Jove.</p>
<p>So spake the soldiery; but she the form<br />
Taking of brave Laodocus, the son<span class="lnm">100</span><br />
Of old Antenor, throughout all the ranks<br />
Sought godlike Pandarus.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_4-4">[4]</a> Ere long she found<br />
The valiant son illustrious of Lycaon,<br />
Standing encompass'd by his dauntless troops,<br />
Broad-shielded warriors, from &AElig;sepus' stream<span class="lnm">105</span><br />
His followers; to his side the Goddess came,<br />
And in wing'd accents ardent him bespake.</p>
<p>Brave offspring of Lycaon, is there hope<br />
That thou wilt hear my counsel? darest thou slip<br />
A shaft at Menelaus? much renown<span class="lnm">110</span><br />
Thou shalt and thanks from all the Trojans win,<br />
But most of all, from Paris, prince of Troy.<br />
From him illustrious gifts thou shalt receive<br />
Doubtless, when Menelaus he shall see<br />
The martial son of Atreus by a shaft<span class="lnm">115</span><br />
Subdued of thine, placed on his funeral pile.<br />
Come. Shoot at Menelaus, glorious Chief!<br />
But vow to Lycian Ph&oelig;bus bow-renown'd<br />
A hecatomb, all firstlings of the flock,<br />
To fair Zeleia's<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_4-5">[5]</a> walls once safe restored.<span class="lnm">120</span></p>
<p>So Pallas spake, to whom infatuate he<br />
Listening, uncased at once his polished bow.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_4-6">[6]</a><br />
<span class="pgnm">089</span><a name="page_089" id="page_089"></a>
That bow, the laden brows of a wild goat<br />
Salacious had supplied; him on a day<br />
Forth-issuing from his cave, in ambush placed<span class="lnm">125</span><br />
He wounded with an arrow to his breast<br />
Dispatch'd, and on the rock supine he fell.<br />
Each horn had from his head tall growth attain'd,<br />
Full sixteen palms; them shaven smooth the smith<br />
Had aptly join'd, and tipt their points with gold.<span class="lnm">130</span><br />
That bow he strung, then, stooping, planted firm<br />
The nether horn, his comrades bold the while<br />
Screening him close with shields, lest ere the prince<br />
Were stricken, Menelaus brave in arms,<br />
The Greeks with fierce assault should interpose.<span class="lnm">135</span><br />
He raised his quiver's lid; he chose a dart<br />
Unflown, full-fledged, and barb'd with pangs of death.<br />
He lodged in haste the arrow on the string,<br />
And vow'd to Lycian Ph&oelig;bus bow-renown'd<br />
A hecatomb, all firstlings of the flock,<span class="lnm">140</span><br />
To fair Zeleia's walls once safe restored.<br />
Compressing next nerve and notch'd arrow-head<br />
He drew back both together, to his pap<br />
Drew home the nerve, the barb home to his bow,<br />
And when the horn was curved to a wide arch,<span class="lnm">145</span><br />
He twang'd it. Whizz'd the bowstring, and the reed<br />
Leap'd off, impatient for the distant throng.</p>
<p>Thee, Menelaus, then the blessed Gods<br />
Forgat not; Pallas huntress of the spoil,<br />
Thy guardian then, baffled the cruel dart.<span class="lnm">150</span><br />
Far as a mother wafts the fly aside<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_4-7">[7]</a><br />
<span class="pgnm">090</span><a name="page_090" id="page_090"></a>
That haunts her slumbering babe, so far she drove<br />
Its course aslant, directing it herself<br />
Against the golden clasps that join'd his belt;<br />
For there the doubled hauberk interposed.<span class="lnm">155</span><br />
The bitter arrow plunged into his belt.<br />
It pierced his broider'd belt, stood fixt within<br />
His twisted hauberk, nor the interior quilt,<br />
Though penetrable least to arrow-points<br />
And his best guard, withheld it, but it pass'd<span class="lnm">160</span><br />
That also, and the Hero's skin inscribed.<br />
Quick flowed a sable current from the wound.</p>
<p>As when a Carian or M&aelig;onian maid<br />
Impurples ivory ordain'd to grace<br />
The cheek of martial steed; safe stored it lies,<span class="lnm">165</span><br />
By many a Chief desired, but proves at last<br />
The stately trapping of some prince,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_4-8">[8]</a> the pride<br />
Of his high pamper'd steed, nor less his own;<br />
Such, Menelaus, seem'd thy shapely thighs,<br />
Thy legs, thy feet, stained with thy trickling blood.<span class="lnm">170</span></p>
<p>Shudder'd King Agamemnon when he saw<br />
The blood fast trickling from the wound, nor less<br />
Shudder'd himself the bleeding warrior bold.<br />
But neck and barb observing from the flesh<br />
Extant, he gather'd heart, and lived again.<span class="lnm">175</span><br />
The royal Agamemnon, sighing, grasp'd<br />
The hand of Menelaus, and while all<br />
Their followers sigh'd around them, thus began.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_4-9">[9]</a></p>
<p><span class="pgnm">091</span><a name="page_091" id="page_091"></a>
I swore thy death, my brother, when I swore<br />
This truce, and set thee forth in sight of Greeks<span class="lnm">180</span><br />
And Trojans, our sole champion; for the foe<br />
Hath trodden underfoot his sacred oath,<br />
And stained it with thy blood. But not in vain,<br />
The truce was ratified, the blood of lambs<br />
Poured forth, libation made, and right hands join'd<span class="lnm">185</span><br />
In holy confidence. The wrath of Jove<br />
May sleep, but will not always; they shall pay<br />
Dear penalty; their own obnoxious heads<br />
Shall be the mulct, their children and their wives.<br />
For this I know, know surely; that a day<span class="lnm">190</span><br />
Shall come, when Ilium, when the warlike King<br />
Of Ilium and his host shall perish all.<br />
Saturnian Jove high-throned, dwelling in heaven,<br />
Resentful of this outrage, then shall shake<br />
His storm-clad &AElig;gis over them. He will;<span class="lnm">195</span><br />
I speak no fable. Time shall prove me true.<br />
But, oh my Menelaus, dire distress<br />
Awaits me, if thy close of life be come,<br />
And thou must die. Then ignominy foul<br />
Shall hunt me back to Argos long-desired;<span class="lnm">200</span><br />
For then all here will recollect their home,<br />
And, hope abandoning, will Helen yield<br />
To be the boast of Priam, and of Troy.<br />
So shall our toils be vain, and while thy bones<br />
Shall waste these clods beneath, Troy's haughty sons<span class="lnm">205</span><br />
The tomb of Menelaus glory-crown'd<br />
Insulting barbarous, shall scoff at me.<br />
So may Atrides, shall they say, perform<br />
His anger still as he performed it here,<br />
Whither he led an unsuccessful host,<span class="lnm">210</span><br />
Whence he hath sail'd again without the spoils,<br />
And where he left his brother's bones to rot.<br />
So shall the Trojan speak; then open earth<br />
<span class="pgnm">092</span><a name="page_092" id="page_092"></a>
Her mouth, and hide me in her deepest gulfs!</p>
<p>But him, the hero of the golden locks<span class="lnm">215</span><br />
Thus cheer'd. My brother, fear not, nor infect<br />
With fear the Grecians; the sharp-pointed reed<br />
Hath touch'd no vital part. The broider'd zone,<br />
The hauberk, and the tough interior quilt,<br />
Work of the armorer, its force repress'd.<span class="lnm">220</span></p>
<p>Him answer'd Agamemnon, King of men.<br />
So be it brother! but the hand of one<br />
Skilful to heal shall visit and shall dress<br />
The wound with drugs of pain-assuaging power.</p>
<p>He ended, and his noble herald, next,<span class="lnm">225</span><br />
Bespake, Talthybius. Haste, call hither quick<br />
The son of &AElig;sculapius, leech renown'd,<br />
The prince Machaon. Bid him fly to attend<br />
The warlike Chieftain Menelaus; him<br />
Some archer, either Lycian or of Troy,<span class="lnm">230</span><br />
A dexterous one, hath stricken with a shaft<br />
To his own glory, and to our distress.</p>
<p>He spake, nor him the herald disobey'd,<br />
But through the Greeks bright-arm'd his course began<br />
The Hero seeking earnest on all sides<span class="lnm">235</span><br />
Machaon. Him, ere long, he station'd saw<br />
Amid the shielded-ranks of his brave band<br />
From steed-famed Tricca drawn, and at his side<br />
With accents ardor-wing'd, him thus address'd.</p>
<p>Haste, Asclepiades! The King of men<span class="lnm">240</span><br />
Calls thee. Delay not. Thou must visit quick<br />
Brave Menelaus, Atreus' son, for him<br />
Some archer, either Lycian or of Troy,<br />
A dexterous one, hath stricken with a shaft<br />
To his own glory, and to our distress.<span class="lnm">245</span></p>
<p>So saying, he roused Machaon, who his course<br />
Through the wide host began. Arriving soon<br />
Where wounded Menelaus stood, while all<br />
The bravest of Achaia's host around<br />
The godlike hero press'd, he strove at once<span class="lnm">250</span><br />
To draw the arrow from his cincture forth.<br />
<span class="pgnm">093</span><a name="page_093" id="page_093"></a>
But, drawing, bent the barbs. He therefore loosed<br />
His broider'd belt, his hauberk and his quilt,<br />
Work of the armorer, and laying bare<br />
His body where the bitter shaft had plow'd<span class="lnm">255</span><br />
His flesh, he suck'd the wound, then spread it o'er<br />
With drugs of balmy power, given on a time<br />
For friendship's sake by Chiron to his sire.</p>
<p>While Menelaus thus the cares engross'd<br />
Of all those Chiefs, the shielded powers of Troy<span class="lnm">260</span><br />
'Gan move toward them, and the Greeks again<br />
Put on their armor, mindful of the fight.<br />
Then hadst thou<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_4-10">[10]</a> not great Agamemnon seen<br />
Slumbering, or trembling, or averse from war,<br />
But ardent to begin his glorious task.<span class="lnm">265</span><br />
His steeds, and his bright chariot brass-inlaid<br />
He left; the snorting steeds Eurymedon,<br />
Offspring of Ptolemy Pira&iuml;des<br />
Detain'd apart; for him he strict enjoin'd<br />
Attendance near, lest weariness of limbs<span class="lnm">270</span><br />
Should seize him marshalling his numerous host.<br />
So forth he went, and through the files on foot<br />
Proceeding, where the warrior Greeks he saw<br />
Alert, he roused them by his words the more.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_4-11">[11]</a></p>
<p>Argives! abate no spark of all your fire.<span class="lnm">275</span><br />
Jove will not prosper traitors. Them who first<br />
Transgress'd the truce the vultures shall devour,<br />
But we (their city taken) shall their wives<br />
Lead captive, and their children home to Greece.</p>
<p>So cheer'd he them. But whom he saw supine,<span class="lnm">280</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">094</span><a name="page_094" id="page_094"></a>
Or in the rugged work of war remiss,<br />
In terms of anger them he stern rebuked.</p>
<p>Oh Greeks! The shame of Argos! Arrow-doom'd!<br />
Blush ye not? Wherefore stand ye thus aghast,<br />
Like fawns which wearied after scouring wide<span class="lnm">285</span><br />
The champain, gaze and pant, and can no more?<br />
Senseless like them ye stand, nor seek the fight.<br />
Is it your purpose patient here to wait<br />
Till Troy invade your vessels on the shore<br />
Of the grey deep, that ye may trial make<span class="lnm">290</span><br />
Of Jove, if he will prove, himself, your shield?</p>
<p>Thus, in discharge of his high office, pass'd<br />
Atrides through the ranks, and now arrived<br />
Where, hardy Chief! Idomeneus in front<br />
Of his bold Cretans stood, stout as a boar<span class="lnm">295</span><br />
The van he occupied, while in the rear<br />
Meriones harangued the most remote.<br />
Them so prepared the King of men beheld<br />
With joyful heart, and thus in courteous terms<br />
Instant the brave Idomeneus address'd.<span class="lnm">300</span></p>
<p>Thee fighting, feasting, howsoe'er employed,<br />
I most respect, Idomeneus, of all<br />
The well-horsed Dan&auml;i; for when the Chiefs<br />
Of Argos, banqueting, their beakers charge<br />
With rosy wine the honorable meed<span class="lnm">305</span><br />
Of valor, thou alone of all the Greeks<br />
Drink'st not by measure.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_4-12">[12]</a> No&mdash;thy goblet stands<br />
Replenish'd still, and like myself thou know'st<br />
No rule or bound, save what thy choice prescribes.<br />
March. Seek the foe. Fight now as heretofore,<span class="lnm">310</span></p>
<p>To whom Idomeneus of Crete replied,<br />
Atrides! all the friendship and the love<br />
<span class="pgnm">095</span><a name="page_095" id="page_095"></a>
Which I have promised will I well perform.<br />
Go; animate the rest, Chief after Chief<br />
Of the Achaians, that the fight begin.<span class="lnm">315</span><br />
For Troy has scatter'd to the winds all faith,<br />
All conscience; and for such her treachery foul<br />
Shall have large recompence of death and wo.</p>
<p>He said, whom Agamemnon at his heart<br />
Exulting, pass'd, and in his progress came<span class="lnm">320</span><br />
Where stood each Ajax; them he found prepared<br />
With all their cloud of infantry behind.<br />
As when the goat-herd on some rocky point<br />
Advanced, a cloud sees wafted o'er the deep<br />
By western gales, and rolling slow along,<span class="lnm">325</span><br />
To him, who stands remote, pitch-black it seems,<br />
And comes with tempest charged; he at the sight<br />
Shuddering, his flock compels into a cave;<br />
So moved the gloomy phalanx, rough with spears,<br />
And dense with shields of youthful warriors bold,<span class="lnm">330</span><br />
Close-following either Ajax to the fight.</p>
<p>Them also, pleased, the King of men beheld,<br />
And in wing'd accents hail'd them as he pass'd.</p>
<p>Brave leaders of the mail-clad host of Greece!<br />
I move not you to duty; ye yourselves<span class="lnm">335</span><br />
Move others, and no lesson need from me.<br />
Jove, Pallas, and Apollo! were but all<br />
Courageous as yourselves, soon Priam's towers<br />
Should totter, and his Ilium storm'd and sack'd<br />
By our victorious bands, stoop to the dust.<span class="lnm">340</span></p>
<p>He ceased, and still proceeding, next arrived<br />
Where stood the Pylian orator, his band<br />
Marshalling under all their leaders bold<br />
Alastor, Chromius, Pelagon the vast,<br />
H&aelig;mon the prince, and Bias, martial Chief.<span class="lnm">345</span><br />
Chariot and horse he station'd in the front;<br />
His numerous infantry, a strong reserve<br />
Right valiant, in the rear; the worst, and those<br />
In whom he trusted least, he drove between,<br />
That such through mere necessity might act.<span class="lnm">350</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">096</span><a name="page_096" id="page_096"></a>
First to his charioteers he gave in charge<br />
Their duty; bade them rein their horses hard,<br />
Shunning confusion. Let no warrior, vain<br />
And overweening of his strength or skill,<br />
Start from his rank to dare the fight alone,<span class="lnm">355</span><br />
Or fall behind it, weakening whom he leaves.<br />
<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_4-13">[13]</a>And if, dismounted from his own, he climb<br />
Another's chariot, let him not affect<br />
Perverse the reins, but let him stand, his spear<br />
Advancing firm, far better so employ'd.<span class="lnm">360</span><br />
Such was the discipline, in ancient times,<br />
Of our forefathers; by these rules they fought<br />
Successful, and laid many a city low.</p>
<p>So counsell'd them the venerable Chief<br />
Long time expert in arms; him also saw<span class="lnm">365</span><br />
King Agamemnon with delight, and said,</p>
<p>Old Chief! ah how I wish, that thy firm heart<br />
Were but supported by as firm a knee!<br />
But time unhinges all. Oh that some youth<br />
Had thine old age, and thou wast young again!<span class="lnm">370</span><br />
To whom the valiant Nestor thus replied.</p>
<p>Atrides, I could also ardent wish<br />
That I were now robust as when I struck<br />
Brave Ereuthalion<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_4-14">[14]</a> breathless to the ground!<br />
But never all their gifts the Gods confer<span class="lnm">375</span><br />
On man at once; if then I had the force<br />
Of youth, I suffer now the effects of age.<br />
Yet ancient as I am, I will be seen<br />
Still mingling with the charioteers, still prompt<br />
To give them counsel; for to counsel youth<span class="lnm">380</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">097</span><a name="page_097" id="page_097"></a>
Is the old warrior's province. Let the green<br />
In years, my juniors, unimpaired by time,<br />
Push with the lance, for they have strength to boast.</p>
<p>So he, whom Agamemnon joyful heard,<br />
And passing thence, the son of Peteos found<span class="lnm">385</span><br />
Menestheus, foremost in equestrian fame,<br />
Among the brave Athenians; near to him<br />
Ulysses held his station, and at hand<br />
The Cephallenians stood, hardy and bold;<br />
For rumor none of the approaching fight<span class="lnm">390</span><br />
Them yet had reach'd, so recent had the stir<br />
Arisen in either host; they, therefore, watch'd<br />
Till the example of some other band<br />
Marching, should prompt them to begin the fight,<br />
But Agamemnon, thus, the King of men<span class="lnm">395</span><br />
Them seeing, sudden and severe reproved.</p>
<p>Menestheus, son of Peteos prince renown'd,<br />
And thou, deviser of all evil wiles!<br />
Adept in artifice! why stand ye here<br />
Appall'd? why wait ye on this distant spot<span class="lnm">400</span><br />
'Till others move? I might expect from you<br />
More readiness to meet the burning war,<br />
Whom foremost I invite of all to share<br />
The banquet, when the Princes feast with me.<br />
There ye are prompt; ye find it pleasant there<span class="lnm">405</span><br />
To eat your savory food, and quaff your wine<br />
Delicious 'till satiety ensue;<br />
But here you could be well content to stand<br />
Spectators only, while ten Grecian troops<br />
Should wage before you the wide-wasting war.<span class="lnm">410</span></p>
<p>To whom Ulysses, with resentful tone<br />
Dark-frowning, thus replied. What words are these<br />
Which have escaped thy lips; and for what cause,<br />
Atrides, hast thou call'd me slow to fight?<br />
When we of Greece shall in sharp contest clash<span class="lnm">415</span><br />
With you steed-tamer Trojans, mark me then;<br />
Then thou shalt see (if the concerns of war<br />
So nearly touch thee, and thou so incline)<br />
<span class="pgnm">098</span><a name="page_098" id="page_098"></a>
The father of Telemachus, engaged<br />
Among the foremost Trojans. But thy speech<span class="lnm">420</span><br />
Was light as is the wind, and rashly made.</p>
<p>When him thus moved he saw, the monarch smiled<br />
Complacent, and in gentler terms replied.</p>
<p>La&euml;rtes' noble son, for wiles renown'd!<br />
Short reprimand and exhortation short<span class="lnm">425</span><br />
Suffice for thee, nor did I purpose more.<br />
For I have known thee long, that thou art one<br />
Of kindest nature, and so much my friend<br />
That we have both one heart. Go therefore thou,<br />
Lead on, and if a word have fallen amiss,<span class="lnm">430</span><br />
We will hereafter mend it, and may heaven<br />
Obliterate in thine heart its whole effect!</p>
<p>He ceased, and ranging still along the line,<br />
The son of Tydeus, Diomede, perceived,<br />
Heroic Chief, by chariots all around<span class="lnm">435</span><br />
Environ'd, and by steeds, at side of whom<br />
Stood Sthenelus, the son of Capaneus.<br />
Him also, Agamemnon, King of men,<br />
In accents of asperity reproved.</p>
<p>Ah, son of Tydeus, Chief of dauntless heart<span class="lnm">440</span><br />
And of equestrian fame! why standest thou<br />
Appall'd, and peering through the walks of war?<br />
So did not Tydeus. In the foremost fight<br />
His favorite station was, as they affirm<br />
Who witness'd his exploits; I never saw<span class="lnm">445</span><br />
Or met him, but by popular report<br />
He was the bravest warrior of his day.<br />
Yet came he once, but not in hostile sort,<br />
To fair Mycen&aelig;, by the godlike prince<br />
Attended, Polynices, at what time<span class="lnm">450</span><br />
The host was called together, and the siege<br />
Was purposed of the sacred city Thebes.<br />
Earnest they sued for an auxiliar band,<br />
Which we had gladly granted, but that Jove<br />
By unpropitious tokens interfered.<span class="lnm">455</span><br />
So forth they went, and on the reedy banks<br />
<span class="pgnm">099</span><a name="page_099" id="page_099"></a>
Arriving of Asopus, there thy sire<br />
By designation of the Greeks was sent<br />
Ambassador, and enter'd Thebes. He found<br />
In Eteocles' palace numerous guests,<span class="lnm">460</span><br />
The sons of Cadmus feasting, among whom,<br />
Although a solitary stranger, stood<br />
Thy father without fear, and challenged forth<br />
Their best to cope with him in manly games.<br />
Them Tydeus vanquish'd easily, such aid<span class="lnm">465</span><br />
Pallas vouchsafed him. Then the spur-arm'd race<br />
Of Cadmus was incensed, and fifty youths<br />
In ambush close expected his return.<br />
Them, Lycophontes obstinate in fight,<br />
Son of Autophonus, and M&aelig;on, son<span class="lnm">470</span><br />
Of H&aelig;mon, Chief of godlike stature, led.<br />
Those also Tydeus slew; M&aelig;on except,<br />
(Whom, warned from heaven, he spared, and sent him home<br />
With tidings of the rest) he slew them all.<br />
Such was &AElig;tolian Tydeus; who begat<span class="lnm">475</span><br />
A son in speech his better, not in arms.</p>
<p>He ended, and his sovereign's awful voice<br />
Tydides reverencing, nought replied;<br />
But thus the son of glorious Capaneus.</p>
<p>Atrides, conscious of the truth, speak truth.<span class="lnm">480</span><br />
We with our sires compared, superior praise<br />
Claim justly.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_4-15">[15]</a> We, confiding in the aid<br />
Of Jove, and in propitious signs from heaven,<br />
Led to the city consecrate to Mars<br />
Our little host, inferior far to theirs,<span class="lnm">485</span><br />
And took seven-gated Thebes, under whose walls<br />
Our fathers by their own imprudence fell.<br />
Their glory, then, match never more with ours.</p>
<p>He spake, whom with a frowning brow the brave<br />
Tydides answer'd. Sthenelus, my friend!<span class="lnm">490</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">100</span><a name="page_100" id="page_100"></a>
I give thee counsel. Mark it. Hold thy peace.<br />
If Agamemnon, who hath charge of all,<br />
Excite his well-appointed host to war,<br />
He hath no blame from me. For should the Greeks<br />
(Her people vanquished) win imperial Troy,<span class="lnm">495</span><br />
The glory shall be his; or, if his host<br />
O'erpower'd in battle perish, his the shame.<br />
Come, therefore; be it ours to rouse at once<br />
To action all the fury of our might.</p>
<p>He said, and from his chariot to the plain<span class="lnm">500</span><br />
Leap'd ardent; rang the armor on the breast<br />
Of the advancing Chief; the boldest heart<br />
Had felt emotion, startled at the sound.</p>
<p>As when the waves by Zephyrus up-heaved<br />
Crowd fast toward some sounding shore, at first,<span class="lnm">505</span><br />
On the broad bosom of the deep their heads<br />
They curl on high, then breaking on the land<br />
Thunder, and o'er the rocks that breast the flood<br />
Borne turgid, scatter far the showery spray;<br />
So moved the Greeks successive, rank by rank,<span class="lnm">510</span><br />
And phalanx after phalanx, every Chief<br />
His loud command proclaiming, while the rest,<br />
As voice in all those thousands none had been<br />
Heard mute; and, in resplendent armor clad,<br />
With martial order terrible advanced.<span class="lnm">515</span><br />
Not so the Trojans came. As sheep, the flock<br />
Of some rich man, by thousands in his court<br />
Penn'd close at milking time, incessant bleat,<br />
Loud answering all their bleating lambs without,<br />
Such din from Ilium's wide-spread host arose.<span class="lnm">520</span><br />
Nor was their shout, nor was their accent one,<br />
But mingled languages were heard of men<br />
From various climes. These Mars to battle roused,<br />
Those Pallas azure-eyed; nor Terror thence<br />
Nor Flight was absent, nor insatiate Strife,<span class="lnm">525</span><br />
Sister and mate of homicidal Mars,<br />
Who small at first, but swift to grow, from earth<br />
Her towering crest lifts gradual to the skies.<br />
<span class="pgnm">101</span><a name="page_101" id="page_101"></a>
She, foe alike to both, the brands dispersed<br />
Of burning hate between them, and the woes<span class="lnm">530</span><br />
Enhanced of battle wheresoe'er she pass'd.</p>
<p>And now the battle join'd. Shield clash'd with shield<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_4-16">[16]</a><br />
And spear with spear, conflicting corselets rang,<br />
Boss'd bucklers met, and tumult wild arose.<br />
Then, many a yell was heard, and many a shout<span class="lnm">535</span><br />
Loud intermix'd, the slayer o'er the maim'd<br />
Exulting, and the field was drench'd with blood.<br />
As when two winter torrents rolling down<br />
The mountains, shoot their floods through gulleys huge<br />
Into one gulf below, station'd remote<span class="lnm">540</span><br />
The shepherd in the uplands hears the roar;<br />
Such was the thunder of the mingling hosts.<br />
And first, Antilochus a Trojan Chief<br />
Slew Echepolus, from Thalysias sprung,<br />
Contending valiant in the van of Troy.<span class="lnm">545</span><br />
Him smiting on his crested casque, he drove<br />
The brazen lance into his front, and pierced<br />
The bones within; night overspread his eyes,<br />
And in fierce battle, like a tower, he fell.<br />
Him fallen by both feet Calchodon's son<span class="lnm">550</span><br />
Seized, royal Elephenor, leader brave<br />
Of the Abantes, and in haste to strip<br />
His armor, drew him from the fight aside.<br />
But short was that attempt. Him so employ'd<br />
Dauntless Agenor mark'd, and as he stoop'd,<span class="lnm">555</span><br />
In his unshielded flank a pointed spear<br />
Implanted deep; he languid sunk and died.<br />
So Elephenor fell, for whom arose<br />
Sharp conflict; Greeks and Trojans mutual flew<br />
Like wolves to battle, and man grappled man.<span class="lnm">560</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">102</span><a name="page_102" id="page_102"></a>
Then Telamonian Ajax, in his prime<br />
Of youthful vigor Sim&ouml;isius slew,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_4-17">[17]</a><br />
Son of Anthemion. Him on Simo&iuml;s' banks<br />
His mother bore, when with her parents once<br />
She came from Ida down to view the flocks,<span class="lnm">565</span><br />
And thence they named him; but his parents'<br />
He lived not to requite, in early youth<br />
Slain by the spear of Ajax famed in arms.<br />
For him advancing Ajax at the pap<br />
Wounded; right through his shoulder driven the point<span class="lnm">570</span><br />
Stood forth behind; he fell, and press'd the dust.<br />
So in some spacious marsh the poplar falls<br />
Smooth-skinn'd, with boughs unladen save aloft;<br />
Some chariot-builder with his axe the trunk<br />
Severs, that he may warp it to a wheel<span class="lnm">575</span><br />
Of shapely form; meantime exposed it lies<br />
To parching airs beside the running stream;<br />
Such Sim&ouml;isius seemed, Anthemion's son,<br />
Whom noble Ajax slew. But soon at him<br />
Antiphus, son of Priam, bright in arms,<span class="lnm">580</span><br />
Hurl'd through the multitude his pointed spear.<br />
He erred from Ajax, but he pierced the groin<br />
Of Leucus, valiant warrior of the band<br />
Led by Ulysses. He the body dragg'd<br />
Apart, but fell beside it, and let fall,<span class="lnm">585</span><br />
Breathless himself, the burthen from his hand.<br />
Then burn'd Ulysses' wrath for Leucus slain,<br />
And through the foremost combatants, array'd<br />
In dazzling arms, he rush'd. Full near he stood,<br />
And, looking keen around him, hurl'd a lance.<span class="lnm">590</span><br />
Back fell the Trojans from before the face<br />
Dispersed of great Ulysses. Not in vain<br />
His weapon flew, but on the field outstretch'd<br />
<span class="pgnm">103</span><a name="page_103" id="page_103"></a>
A spurious son of Priam, from the shores<br />
Call'd of Abydus famed for fleetest mares,<span class="lnm">595</span><br />
Democoon; him, for Leucus' sake enraged,<br />
Ulysses through both temples with his spear<br />
Transpierced. The night of death hung on his eyes,<br />
And sounding on his batter'd arms he fell.<br />
Then Hector and the van of Troy retired;<span class="lnm">600</span><br />
Loud shout the Grecians; these draw off the dead,<br />
Those onward march amain, and from the heights<br />
Of Pergamus Apollo looking down<br />
In anger, to the Trojans called aloud.</p>
<p>Turn, turn, ye Trojans! face your Grecian foes.<span class="lnm">605</span><br />
They, like yourselves, are vulnerable flesh,<br />
Not adamant or steel. Your direst dread<br />
Achilles, son of Thetis radiant-hair'd,<br />
Fights not, but sullen in his fleet abides.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_4-18">[18]</a></p>
<p>Such from the citadel was heard the voice<span class="lnm">610</span><br />
Of dread Apollo. But Minerva ranged<br />
Meantime, Tritonian progeny of Jove,<br />
The Grecians, rousing whom she saw remiss.<br />
Then Amarynceus' son, Diores, felt<br />
The force of fate, bruised by a rugged rock<span class="lnm">615</span><br />
At his right heel, which Pirus, Thracian Chief,<br />
The son of Imbrasus of &AElig;nos, threw.<br />
Bones and both tendons in its fall the mass<br />
Enormous crush'd. He, stretch'd in dust supine,<br />
With palms outspread toward his warrior friends<span class="lnm">620</span><br />
Lay gasping life away. But he who gave<br />
The fatal blow, Pirus, advancing, urged<br />
Into his navel a keen lance, and shed<br />
His bowels forth; then, darkness veil'd his eyes.</p>
<p>Nor Pirus long survived; him through the breast<span class="lnm">625</span><br />
Above the pap, &AElig;tolian Thoas pierced,<br />
And in his lungs set fast the quivering spear.<br />
Then Thoas swift approach'd, pluck'd from the wound<br />
<span class="pgnm">104</span><a name="page_104" id="page_104"></a>
His stormy spear, and with his falchion bright<br />
Gashing his middle belly, stretch'd him dead.<span class="lnm">630</span><br />
Yet stripp'd he not the slain, whom with long spears<br />
His Thracians hairy-scalp'd<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_4-19">[19]</a> so round about<br />
Encompassed, that though bold and large of limb<br />
Were Thoas, from before them him they thrust<br />
Staggering and reeling in his forced retreat.<span class="lnm">635</span></p>
<p>They therefore in the dust, the Epean Chief<br />
Diores, and the Thracian, Pirus lay<br />
Stretch'd side by side, with numerous slain around.</p>
<p>Then had Minerva led through all that field<br />
Some warrior yet unhurt, him sheltering safe<span class="lnm">640</span><br />
From all annoyance dread of dart or spear,<br />
No cause of blame in either had he found<br />
That day, so many Greeks and Trojans press'd,<br />
Extended side by side, the dusty plain.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="noind">Then Athen&aelig;an Pallas on the son<br />
Of Tydeus,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_5-1">[1]</a> Diomede, new force conferr'd<br />
And daring courage, that the Argives all<br />
He might surpass, and deathless fame achieve.<br />
Fires on his helmet and his shield around<span class="lnm">5</span><br />
She kindled, bright and steady as the star<br />
Autumnal,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_5-2">[2]</a> which in Ocean newly bathed<br />
Assumes fresh beauty; with such glorious beams<br />
His head encircling and his shoulders broad,<br />
She urged him forth into the thickest fight.<span class="lnm">10</span></p>
<p>There lived a man in Troy, Dares his name,<br />
The priest of Vulcan; rich he was and good,<br />
The father of two sons, Id&aelig;us this,<br />
That, Phegeus call'd; accomplish'd warriors both.<br />
These, issuing from their phalanx, push'd direct<span class="lnm">15</span><br />
Their steeds at Diomede, who fought on foot.<br />
When now small interval was left between,<br />
First Phegeus his long-shadow'd spear dismiss'd;<br />
But over Diomede's left shoulder pass'd<br />
<span class="pgnm">108</span><a name="page_108" id="page_108"></a>
The point, innocuous. Then his splendid lance<span class="lnm">20</span><br />
Tydides hurl'd; nor ineffectual flew<br />
The weapon from his hand, but Phegeus pierced<br />
His paps between, and forced him to the ground.<br />
At once, his sumptuous chariot left, down leap'd<br />
Id&aelig;sus, wanting courage to defend<span class="lnm">25</span><br />
His brother slain; nor had he scaped himself<br />
His louring fate, but Vulcan, to preserve<br />
His ancient priest from unmixt sorrow, snatch'd<br />
The fugitive in darkness wrapt, away.<br />
Then brave Tydides, driving off the steeds,<span class="lnm">30</span><br />
Consign'd them to his fellow-warriors' care,<br />
That they might lead them down into the fleet.</p>
<p>The valiant Trojans, when they saw the sons<br />
Of Dares, one beside his chariot slain,<br />
And one by flight preserved, through all their host<span class="lnm">35</span><br />
Felt consternation. Then Minerva seized<br />
The hand of fiery Mars, and thus she spake.</p>
<p>Gore-tainted homicide, town-battering Mars!<br />
Leave we the Trojans and the Greeks to wage<br />
Fierce fight alone, Jove prospering whom he will,<span class="lnm">40</span><br />
So shall we not provoke our father's ire.</p>
<p>She said, and from the fight conducted forth<br />
The impetuous Deity, whom on the side<br />
She seated of Scamander deep-embank'd.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_5-3">[3]</a></p>
<p>And now the host of Troy to flight inclined<span class="lnm">45</span><br />
Before the Grecians, and the Chiefs of Greece<br />
Each slew a warrior. Agamemnon first<br />
Gigantic Odius from his chariot hurl'd.<br />
Chief of the Halizonians. He to flight<br />
Turn'd foremost, when the monarch in his spine<span class="lnm">50</span><br />
Between the shoulder-bones his spear infixt,<br />
And urged it through his breast. Sounding he fell,<br />
And loud his batter'd armor rang around.</p>
<p>By brave Idomeneus a Lydian died,<br />
Ph&aelig;stus, from fruitful Tarne sent to Troy,<span class="lnm">55</span><br />
Son of M&aelig;onian Borus; him his steeds<br />
<span class="pgnm">109</span><a name="page_109" id="page_109"></a>
Mounting, Idomeneus the spear-renown'd<br />
Through his right shoulder pierced; unwelcome night<br />
Involved him; from his chariot down he fell,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_5-4">[4]</a><br />
And the attendant Cretans stripp'd his arms.<span class="lnm">60</span></p>
<p>But Menelaus, son of Atreus slew<br />
With his bright spear Scamandrius, Stropius' son,<br />
A skilful hunter; for Diana him,<br />
Herself, the slaughter of all savage kinds<br />
Had taught, on mountain or in forest bred.<span class="lnm">65</span><br />
But she, shaft-aiming Goddess, in that hour<br />
Avail'd him not, nor his own matchless skill;<br />
For Menelaus, Atreus son spear-famed,<br />
Him flying wounded in the spine between<br />
His shoulders, and the spear urged through his breast.<span class="lnm">70</span><br />
Prone on his loud-resounding arms he fell.</p>
<p>Next, by Meriones, Phereclus died,<br />
Son of Harmonides. All arts that ask<br />
A well-instructed hand his sire had learn'd,<br />
For Pallas dearly loved him. He the fleet,<span class="lnm">75</span><br />
Prime source of harm to Troy and to himself,<br />
For Paris built, unskill'd to spell aright<br />
The oracles predictive of the wo.<br />
Phereclus fled; Meriones his flight<br />
Outstripping, deep in his posterior flesh<span class="lnm">80</span><br />
A spear infix'd; sliding beneath the bone<br />
It grazed his bladder as it pass'd, and stood<br />
Protruded far before. Low on his knees<br />
Phereclus sank, and with a shriek expired.<br />
<span class="pgnm">110</span><a name="page_110" id="page_110"></a>
Ped&aelig;us, whom, although his spurious son,<span class="lnm">85</span><br />
Antenor's wife, to gratify her lord,<br />
Had cherish'd as her own&mdash;him Meges slew.<br />
Warlike Phylides<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_5-5">[5]</a> following close his flight,<br />
His keen lance drove into his poll, cut sheer<br />
His tongue within, and through his mouth enforced<span class="lnm">90</span><br />
The glittering point. He, prostrate in the dust,<br />
The cold steel press'd between his teeth and died.</p>
<p>Eurypylus, Evemon's son, the brave<br />
Hypsenor slew; Dolopion was his sire,<br />
Priest of Scamander, reverenced as a God.<span class="lnm">95</span><br />
In vain before Eurypylus he fled;<br />
He, running, with his falchion lopp'd his arm<br />
Fast by the shoulder; on the field his hand<br />
Fell blood-distained, and destiny severe<br />
With shades of death for ever veil'd his eyes.<span class="lnm">100</span></p>
<p>Thus strenuous they the toilsome battle waged.<br />
But where Tydides fought, whether in aid<br />
Of Ilium's host, or on the part of Greece,<br />
Might none discern. For as a winter-flood<br />
Impetuous, mounds and bridges sweeps away;<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_5-6">[6]</a><span class="lnm">105</span><br />
The buttress'd bridge checks not its sudden force,<br />
The firm inclosure of vine-planted fields<br />
Luxuriant, falls before it; finish'd works<br />
Of youthful hinds, once pleasant to the eye,<br />
Now levell'd, after ceaseless rain from Jove;<span class="lnm">110</span><br />
So drove Tydides into sudden flight<br />
The Trojans; phalanx after phalanx fled<br />
Before the terror of his single arm.</p>
<p>When him Lycaon's son illustrious saw<br />
Scouring the field, and from before his face<span class="lnm">115</span><br />
The ranks dispersing wide, at once he bent<br />
Against Tydides his elastic bow.<br />
<span class="pgnm">111</span><a name="page_111" id="page_111"></a>
The arrow met him in his swift career<br />
Sure-aim'd; it struck direct the hollow mail<br />
Of his right shoulder, with resistless force<span class="lnm">120</span><br />
Transfix'd it, and his hauberk stain'd with blood.<br />
Loud shouted then Lycaon's son renown'd.</p>
<p>Rush on, ye Trojans, spur your coursers hard.<br />
Our fiercest foe is wounded, and I deem<br />
His death not distant far, if me the King<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_5-7">[7]</a><span class="lnm">125</span><br />
Jove's son, indeed, from Lycia sent to Troy.</p>
<p>So boasted Pandarus. Yet him the dart<br />
Quell'd not. Retreating, at his coursers' heads<br />
He stood, and to the son of Capaneus<br />
His charioteer and faithful friend he said.<span class="lnm">130</span></p>
<p>Arise, sweet son of Capaneus, dismount,<br />
And from my shoulder draw this bitter shaft.</p>
<p>He spake; at once the son of Capaneus<br />
Descending, by its barb the bitter shaft<br />
Drew forth; blood spouted through his twisted mail<span class="lnm">135</span><br />
Incontinent, and thus the Hero pray'd.</p>
<p>Unconquer'd daughter of Jove &AElig;gis-arm'd!<br />
If ever me, propitious, or my sire<br />
Thou hast in furious fight help'd heretofore,<br />
Now aid me also. Bring within the reach<span class="lnm">140</span><br />
Of my swift spear, Oh grant me to strike through<br />
The warrior who hath check'd my course, and boasts<br />
The sun's bright beams for ever quench'd to me!<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_5-8">[8]</a></p>
<p>He prayed, and Pallas heard; she braced his limbs,<br />
She wing'd him with alacrity divine,<span class="lnm">145</span><br />
And, standing at his side, him thus bespake.</p>
<p>Now Diomede, be bold! Fight now with Troy.<br />
To thee, thy father's spirit I impart<br />
Fearless; shield-shaking Tydeus felt the same.<br />
I also from thine eye the darkness purge<span class="lnm">150</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">112</span><a name="page_112" id="page_112"></a>
Which dimm'd thy sight<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_5-9">[9]</a> before, that thou may'st know<br />
Both Gods and men; should, therefore, other God<br />
Approach to try thee, fight not with the powers<br />
Immortal; but if foam-born Venus come,<br />
Her spare not. Wound her with thy glittering spear.<span class="lnm">155</span></p>
<p>So spake the blue-eyed Deity, and went,<br />
Then with the champions in the van again<br />
Tydides mingled; hot before, he fights<br />
With threefold fury now, nor less enraged<br />
Than some gaunt lion whom o'erleaping light<span class="lnm">160</span><br />
The fold, a shepherd hath but gall'd, not kill'd,<br />
Him irritating more; thenceforth the swain<br />
Lurks unresisting; flies the abandon'd flock;<br />
Heaps slain on heaps he leaves, and with a bound<br />
Surmounting all impediment, escapes;<span class="lnm">165</span><br />
Such seem'd the valiant Diomede incensed<br />
To fury, mingling with the host of Troy.</p>
<p>Astyno&uuml;s and Hypenor first he slew;<br />
One with his brazen lance above the pap<br />
He pierced, and one with his huge falchion smote<span class="lnm">170</span><br />
Fast by the key-bone,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_5-10">[10]</a> from the neck and spine<br />
His parted shoulder driving at a blow.</p>
<p>Them leaving, Polyides next he sought<br />
And Abas, sons of a dream-dealing seer,<br />
Eurydamas; their hoary father's dreams<span class="lnm">175</span><br />
Or not interpreted, or kept concealed,<br />
Them saved not, for by Diomede they died.<br />
Xanthus and Th&ouml;on he encounter'd next,<br />
Both sons of Ph&aelig;nops, sons of his old age,<br />
Who other heir had none of all his wealth,<span class="lnm">180</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">113</span><a name="page_113" id="page_113"></a>
Nor hoped another, worn with many years.<br />
Tydides slew them both; nor aught remain'd<br />
To the old man but sorrow for his sons<br />
For ever lost, and strangers were his heirs.<br />
Two sons of Priam in one chariot borne<span class="lnm">185</span><br />
Echemon next, and Chromius felt his hand<br />
Resistless. As a lion on the herd<br />
Leaping, while they the shrubs and bushes browse,<br />
Breaks short the neck of heifer or of steer,<br />
So them, though clinging fast and loth to fall,<span class="lnm">190</span><br />
Tydides hurl'd together to the ground,<br />
Then stripp'd their splendid armor, and the steeds<br />
Consigned and chariot to his soldiers' care.</p>
<p>&AElig;neas him discern'd scattering the ranks,<br />
And through the battle and the clash of spears<span class="lnm">195</span><br />
Went seeking godlike Pandarus; ere long<br />
Finding Lycaon's martial son renown'd,<br />
He stood before him, and him thus address'd.</p>
<p>Thy bow, thy feather'd shafts, and glorious name<br />
Where are they, Pandarus? whom none of Troy<span class="lnm">200</span><br />
Could equal, whom of Lycia, none excel.<br />
Come. Lift thine hands to Jove, and at yon Chief<br />
Dispatch an arrow, who afflicts the host<br />
Of Ilium thus, conquering where'er he flies,<br />
And who hath slaughter'd numerous brave in arms,<span class="lnm">205</span><br />
But him some Deity I rather deem<br />
Avenging on us his neglected rites,<br />
And who can stand before an angry God?</p>
<p>Him answer'd then Lycaon's son renown'd.<br />
Brave leader of the Trojans brazen-mail'd,<span class="lnm">210</span><br />
&AElig;neas! By his buckler which I know,<br />
And by his helmet's height, considering, too<br />
His steeds, I deem him Diomede the bold;<br />
Yet such pronounce him not, who seems a God.<br />
But if bold Diomede indeed he be<span class="lnm">215</span><br />
Of whom I speak, not without aid from heaven<br />
His fury thus prevails, but at his side<br />
Some God, in clouds enveloped, turns away<br />
<span class="pgnm">114</span><a name="page_114" id="page_114"></a>
From him the arrow to a devious course.<br />
Already, at his shoulder's hollow mail<span class="lnm">220</span><br />
My shaft hath pierced him through, and him I deem'd<br />
Dismiss'd full sure to Pluto ere his time<br />
But he survives; whom therefore I at last<br />
Perforce conclude some angry Deity.<br />
Steeds have I none or chariot to ascend,<span class="lnm">225</span><br />
Who have eleven chariots in the stands<br />
Left of Lycaon, with fair hangings all<br />
O'ermantled, strong, new finish'd, with their steeds<br />
In pairs beside them, eating winnow'd grain.<br />
Me much Lycaon my old valiant sire<span class="lnm">230</span><br />
At my departure from his palace gates<br />
Persuaded, that my chariot and my steeds<br />
Ascending, I should so conduct my bands<br />
To battle; counsel wise, and ill-refused!<br />
But anxious, lest (the host in Troy so long<span class="lnm">235</span><br />
Immew'd) my steeds, fed plenteously at home,<br />
Should here want food, I left them, and on foot<br />
To Ilium came, confiding in my bow<br />
Ordain'd at last to yield me little good.<br />
Twice have I shot, and twice I struck the mark,<span class="lnm">240</span><br />
First Menelaus, and Tydides next;<br />
From each I drew the blood, true, genuine blood,<br />
Yet have but more incensed them. In an hour<br />
Unfortunate, I therefore took my bow<br />
Down from the wall that day, when for the sake<span class="lnm">245</span><br />
Of noble Hector, to these pleasant plains<br />
I came, a leader on the part of Troy.<br />
But should I once return, and with these eyes<br />
Again behold my native land, my sire,<br />
My wife, my stately mansion, may the hand,<span class="lnm">250</span><br />
That moment, of some adversary there<br />
Shorten me by the head, if I not snap<br />
This bow with which I charged myself in vain,<br />
And burn the unprofitable tool to dust.</p>
<p>To whom &AElig;neas, Trojan Chief, replied.<span class="lnm">255</span><br />
Nay, speak not so. For ere that hour arrive<br />
<span class="pgnm">115</span><a name="page_115" id="page_115"></a>
We will, with chariot and with horse, in arms<br />
Encounter him, and put his strength to proof.<br />
Delay not, mount my chariot. Thou shalt see<br />
With what rapidity the steeds of Troy<span class="lnm">260</span><br />
Pursuing or retreating, scour the field.<br />
If after all, Jove purpose still to exalt<br />
The son of Tydeus, these shall bear us safe<br />
Back to the city. Come then. Let us on.<br />
The lash take thou, and the resplendent reins,<span class="lnm">265</span><br />
While I alight for battle, or thyself<br />
Receive them, and the steeds shall be my care.</p>
<p>Him answer'd then Lycaon's son renown'd.<br />
&AElig;neas! manage thou the reins, and guide<br />
Thy proper steeds. If fly at last we must<span class="lnm">270</span><br />
The son of Tydeus, they will readier draw<br />
Directed by their wonted charioteer.<br />
Else, terrified, and missing thy control,<br />
They may refuse to bear us from the fight,<br />
And Tydeus' son assailing us, with ease<span class="lnm">275</span><br />
Shall slay us both, and drive thy steeds away.<br />
Rule therefore thou the chariot, and myself<br />
With my sharp spear will his assault receive.</p>
<p>So saying, they mounted both, and furious drove<br />
Against Tydides. Them the noble son<span class="lnm">280</span><br />
Of Capaneus observed, and turning quick<br />
His speech to Diomede, him thus address'd.</p>
<p>Tydides, Diomede, my heart's delight!<br />
Two warriors of immeasurable force<br />
In battle, ardent to contend with thee,<span class="lnm">285</span><br />
Come rattling on. Lycaon's offspring one,<br />
Bow-practised Pandarus; with whom appears<br />
&AElig;neas; he who calls the mighty Chief<br />
Anchises father, and whom Venus bore.<br />
Mount&mdash;drive we swift away&mdash;lest borne so far<span class="lnm">290</span><br />
Beyond the foremost battle, thou be slain.</p>
<p>To whom, dark-frowning, Diomede replied<br />
Speak not of flight to me, who am disposed<br />
To no such course. I am ashamed to fly<br />
<span class="pgnm">116</span><a name="page_116" id="page_116"></a>
Or tremble, and my strength is still entire;<span class="lnm">295</span><br />
I cannot mount. No. Rather thus, on foot,<br />
I will advance against them. Fear and dread<br />
Are not for me; Pallas forbids the thought.<br />
One falls, be sure; swift as they are, the steeds<br />
That whirl them on, shall never rescue both.<span class="lnm">300</span><br />
But hear my bidding, and hold fast the word.<br />
Should all-wise Pallas grant me my desire<br />
To slay them both, drive not my coursers hence,<br />
But hook the reins, and seizing quick the pair<br />
That draw &AElig;neas, urge them from the powers<span class="lnm">305</span><br />
Of Troy away into the host of Greece.<br />
For they are sprung from those which Jove to Tros<br />
In compensation gave for Ganymede;<br />
The Sun himself sees not their like below.<br />
Anchises, King of men, clandestine them<span class="lnm">310</span><br />
Obtain'd, his mares submitting to the steeds<br />
Of King Laomedon. Six brought him foals;<br />
Four to himself reserving, in his stalls<br />
He fed them sleek, and two he gave his son:<br />
These, might we win them, were a noble prize.<span class="lnm">315</span></p>
<p>Thus mutual they conferr'd; those Chiefs, the while,<br />
With swiftest pace approach'd, and first his speech<br />
To Diomede Lycaon's son address'd.</p>
<p>Heroic offspring of a noble sire,<br />
Brave son of Tydeus! false to my intent<span class="lnm">320</span><br />
My shaft hath harm'd thee little. I will now<br />
Make trial with my spear, if that may speed.</p>
<p>He said, and shaking his long-shadow'd spear,<br />
Dismiss'd it. Forceful on the shield it struck<br />
Of Diomede, transpierced it, and approach'd<span class="lnm">325</span><br />
With threatening point the hauberk on his breast.<br />
Loud shouted Pandarus&mdash;Ah nobly thrown!<br />
Home to thy bowels. Die, for die thou must,<br />
And all the glory of thy death is mine.</p>
<p>Then answer thus brave Diomede return'd<span class="lnm">330</span><br />
Undaunted. I am whole. Thy cast was short.<br />
But ye desist not, as I plain perceive,<br />
<span class="pgnm">117</span><a name="page_117" id="page_117"></a>
Till one at least extended on the plain<br />
Shall sate the God of battles with his blood.</p>
<p>He said and threw. Pallas the spear herself<span class="lnm">335</span><br />
Directed; at his eye fast by the nose<br />
Deep-entering, through his ivory teeth it pass'd,<br />
At its extremity divided sheer<br />
His tongue, and started through his chin below.<br />
He headlong fell, and with his dazzling arms<span class="lnm">340</span><br />
Smote full the plain. Back flew the fiery steeds<br />
With swift recoil, and where he fell he died.<br />
Then sprang &AElig;neas forth with spear and shield,<br />
That none might drag the body;<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_5-11">[11]</a> lion-like<br />
He stalk'd around it, oval shield and spear<span class="lnm">345</span><br />
Advancing firm, and with incessant cries<br />
Terrific, death denouncing on his foes.<br />
But Diomede with hollow grasp a stone<br />
Enormous seized, a weight to overtask<br />
Two strongest men of such as now are strong,<span class="lnm">350</span><br />
Yet he, alone, wielded the rock with ease.<br />
Full on the hip he smote him, where the thigh<br />
Rolls in its cavity, the socket named.<br />
He crushed the socket, lacerated wide<br />
Both tendons, and with that rough-angled mass<span class="lnm">355</span><br />
Flay'd all his flesh, The Hero on his knees<br />
Sank, on his ample palm his weight upbore<br />
Laboring, and darkness overspread his eyes.</p>
<p>There had &AElig;neas perish'd, King of men,<br />
Had not Jove's daughter Venus quick perceived<span class="lnm">360</span><br />
His peril imminent, whom she had borne<br />
Herself to Anchises pasturing his herds.<br />
Her snowy arras her darling son around<br />
She threw maternal, and behind a fold<br />
Of her bright mantle screening close his breast<span class="lnm">365</span><br />
From mortal harm by some brave Grecian's spear,<br />
<span class="pgnm">118</span><a name="page_118" id="page_118"></a>
Stole him with eager swiftness from the fight.</p>
<p>Nor then forgat brave Sthenelus his charge<br />
Received from Diomede, but his own steeds<br />
Detaining distant from the boisterous war,<span class="lnm">370</span><br />
Stretch'd tight the reins, and hook'd them fast behind.<br />
The coursers of &AElig;neas next he seized<br />
Ardent, and them into the host of Greece<br />
Driving remote, consign'd them to his care,<br />
Whom far above all others his compeers<span class="lnm">375</span><br />
He loved, Deipylus, his bosom friend<br />
Congenial. Him he charged to drive them thence<br />
Into the fleet, then, mounting swift his own,<br />
Lash'd after Diomede; he, fierce in arms,<br />
Pursued the Cyprian Goddess, conscious whom,<span class="lnm">380</span><br />
Not Pallas, not Enyo, waster dread<br />
Of cities close-beleaguer'd, none of all<br />
Who o'er the battle's bloody course preside,<br />
But one of softer kind and prone to fear.<br />
When, therefore, her at length, after long chase<span class="lnm">385</span><br />
Through all the warring multitude he reach'd,<br />
With his protruded spear her gentle hand<br />
He wounded, piercing through her thin attire<br />
Ambrosial, by themselves the graces wrought,<br />
Her inside wrist, fast by the rosy palm.<span class="lnm">390</span><br />
Blood follow'd, but immortal; ichor pure,<br />
Such as the blest inhabitants of heaven<br />
May bleed, nectareous; for the Gods eat not<br />
Man's food, nor slake as he with sable wine<br />
Their thirst, thence bloodless and from death exempt.<span class="lnm">395</span><br />
She, shrieking, from her arms cast down her son,<br />
And Ph&oelig;bus, in impenetrable clouds<br />
Him hiding, lest the spear of some brave Greek<br />
Should pierce his bosom, caught him swift away.<br />
Then shouted brave Tydides after her&mdash;<span class="lnm">400</span></p>
<p>Depart, Jove's daughter! fly the bloody field.<br />
Is't not enough that thou beguilest the hearts<br />
Of feeble women? If thou dare intrude<br />
Again into the war, war's very name<br />
<span class="pgnm">119</span><a name="page_119" id="page_119"></a>
Shall make thee shudder, wheresoever heard.<span class="lnm">405</span></p>
<p>He said, and Venus with excess of pain<br />
Bewilder'd went; but Iris tempest-wing'd<br />
Forth led her through the multitude, oppress'd<br />
With anguish, her white wrist to livid changed.<br />
They came where Mars far on the left retired<span class="lnm">410</span><br />
Of battle sat, his horses and his spear<br />
In darkness veil'd. Before her brother's knees<br />
She fell, and with entreaties urgent sought<br />
The succor of his coursers golden-rein'd.</p>
<p>Save me, my brother! Pity me! Thy steeds<span class="lnm">415</span><br />
Give me, that they may bear me to the heights<br />
Olympian, seat of the immortal Gods!<br />
Oh! I am wounded deep; a mortal man<br />
Hath done it, Diomede; nor would he fear<br />
This day in fight the Sire himself of all.<span class="lnm">420</span></p>
<p>Then Mars his coursers gold-caparison'd<br />
Resign'd to Venus; she, with countenance sad,<br />
The chariot climb'd, and Iris at her side<br />
The bright reins seizing lash'd the ready steeds.<br />
Soon as the Olympian heights, seat of the Gods,<span class="lnm">425</span><br />
They reach'd, wing-footed Iris loosing quick<br />
The coursers, gave them large whereon to browse<br />
Ambrosial food; but Venus on the knees<br />
Sank of Dione, who with folded arms<br />
Maternal, to her bosom straining close<span class="lnm">430</span><br />
Her daughter, stroked her cheek, and thus inquired.</p>
<p>My darling child! who? which of all the Gods<br />
Hath rashly done such violence to thee<br />
As if convicted of some open wrong?</p>
<p>Her then the Goddess of love-kindling smiles<span class="lnm">435</span><br />
Venus thus answer'd; Diomede the proud,<br />
Audacious Diomede; he gave the wound,<br />
For that I stole &AElig;neas from the fight<br />
My son of all mankind my most beloved;<br />
Nor is it now the war of Greece with Troy,<span class="lnm">440</span><br />
But of the Grecians with the Gods themselves.</p>
<p>Then thus Dione, Goddess all divine.<br />
<span class="pgnm">120</span><a name="page_120" id="page_120"></a>
My child! how hard soe'er thy sufferings seem<br />
Endure them patiently. Full many a wrong<br />
From human hands profane the Gods endure,<span class="lnm">445</span><br />
And many a painful stroke, mankind from ours.<br />
Mars once endured much wrong, when on a time<br />
Him Otus bound and Ephialtes fast,<br />
Sons of Al&ouml;eus, and full thirteen moons<br />
In brazen thraldom held him. There, at length,<span class="lnm">450</span><br />
The fierce blood-nourished Mars had pined away,<br />
But that E&euml;rib&oelig;a, loveliest nymph,<br />
His step-mother, in happy hour disclosed<br />
To Mercury the story of his wrongs;<br />
He stole the prisoner forth, but with his woes<span class="lnm">455</span><br />
Already worn, languid and fetter-gall'd.<br />
Nor Juno less endured, when erst the bold<br />
Son of Amphytrion with tridental shaft<br />
Her bosom pierced; she then the misery felt<br />
Of irremediable pain severe.<span class="lnm">460</span><br />
Nor suffer'd Pluto less, of all the Gods<br />
Gigantic most, by the same son of Jove<br />
Alcides, at the portals of the dead<br />
Transfix'd and fill'd with anguish; he the house<br />
Of Jove and the Olympian summit sought<span class="lnm">465</span><br />
Dejected, torture-stung, for sore the shaft<br />
Oppress'd him, into his huge shoulder driven.<br />
But P&aelig;on<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_5-12">[12]</a> him not liable to death<br />
With unction smooth of salutiferous balms<br />
Heal'd soon. Presumptuous, sacrilegious man!<span class="lnm">470</span><br />
Careless what dire enormities he wrought,<br />
Who bent his bow against the powers of heaven!<br />
But blue-eyed Pallas instigated him<br />
By whom thou bleed'st. Infatuate! he forgets<br />
That whoso turns against the Gods his arm<span class="lnm">475</span><br />
Lives never long; he never, safe escaped<br />
From furious fight, the lisp'd caresses hears<br />
<span class="pgnm">121</span><a name="page_121" id="page_121"></a>
Of his own infants prattling at his knees.<br />
Let therefore Diomede beware, lest strong<br />
And valiant as he is, he chance to meet<span class="lnm">490</span><br />
Some mightier foe than thou, and lest his wife,<br />
Daughter of King Adrastus, the discrete<br />
&AElig;gialea, from portentous dreams<br />
Upstarting, call her family to wail<br />
Her first-espoused, Achaia's proudest boast,<span class="lnm">485</span><br />
Diomede, whom she must behold no more.</p>
<p>She said, and from her wrist with both hands wiped<br />
The trickling ichor; the effectual touch<br />
Divine chased all her pains, and she was heal'd.<br />
Them Juno mark'd and Pallas, and with speech<span class="lnm">490</span><br />
Sarcastic pointed at Saturnian Jove<br />
To vex him, blue-eyed Pallas thus began.</p>
<p>Eternal father! may I speak my thought,<br />
And not incense thee, Jove? I can but judge<br />
That Venus, while she coax'd some Grecian fair<span class="lnm">495</span><br />
To accompany the Trojans whom she loves<br />
With such extravagance, hath heedless stroked<br />
Her golden clasps, and scratch'd her lily hand.</p>
<p>So she; then smiled the sire of Gods and men,<br />
And calling golden Venus, her bespake.<span class="lnm">500</span></p>
<p>War and the tented field, my beauteous child,<br />
Are not for thee. Thou rather shouldst be found<br />
In scenes of matrimonial bliss. The toils<br />
Of war to Pallas and to Mars belong.</p>
<p>Thus they in heaven. But Diomede the while<span class="lnm">505</span><br />
Sprang on &AElig;neas, conscious of the God<br />
Whose hand o'ershadow'd him, yet even him<br />
Regarding lightly; for he burn'd to slay<br />
&AElig;neas, and to seize his glorious arms.<br />
Thrice then he sprang impetuous to the deed,<span class="lnm">510</span><br />
And thrice Apollo with his radiant shield<br />
Repulsed him. But when ardent as a God<br />
The fourth time he advanced, with thundering-voice<br />
Him thus the Archer of the skies rebuked.</p>
<p>Think, and retire, Tydides! nor affect<span class="lnm">515</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">122</span><a name="page_122" id="page_122"></a>
Equality with Gods; for not the same<br />
Our nature is and theirs who tread the ground.</p>
<p>He spake, and Diomede a step retired,<br />
Not more; the anger of the Archer-God<br />
Declining slow, and with a sullen awe.<span class="lnm">520</span><br />
Then Ph&oelig;bus, far from all the warrior throng<br />
To his own shrine the sacred dome beneath<br />
Of Pergamus, &AElig;neas bore; there him<br />
Latona and shaft-arm'd Diana heal'd<br />
And glorified within their spacious fane.<span class="lnm">525</span><br />
Meantime the Archer of the silver bow<br />
A visionary form prepared; it seem'd<br />
Himself &AElig;neas, and was arm'd as he.<br />
At once, in contest for that airy form,<br />
Grecians and Trojans on each other's breasts<span class="lnm">530</span><br />
The bull-hide buckler batter'd and light targe.</p>
<p>Then thus Apollo to the warrior God.<br />
Gore-tainted homicide, town-batterer Mars!<br />
Wilt thou not meet and from the fight withdraw<br />
This man Tydides, now so fiery grown<span class="lnm">535</span><br />
That he would even cope with Jove himself?<br />
First Venus' hand he wounded, and assail'd<br />
Impetuous as a God, next, even me.<br />
He ceased, and on the topmost turret sat<br />
Of Pergamus. Then all-destroyer Mars<span class="lnm">540</span><br />
Ranging the Trojan host, rank after rank<br />
Exhorted loud, and in the form assumed<br />
Of Acamas the Thracian leader bold,<br />
The godlike sons of Priam thus harangued.</p>
<p>Ye sons of Priam, monarch Jove-beloved!<span class="lnm">545</span><br />
How long permit ye your Achaian foes<br />
To slay the people?&mdash;till the battle rage<br />
(Push'd home to Ilium) at her solid gates?<br />
Behold&mdash;a Chief disabled lies, than whom<br />
We reverence not even Hector more,<span class="lnm">550</span><br />
&AElig;neas; fly, save from the roaring storm<br />
The noble Anchisiades your friend.</p>
<p>He said; then every heart for battle glow'd;<br />
<span class="pgnm">123</span><a name="page_123" id="page_123"></a>
And thus Sarpedon with rebuke severe<br />
Upbraiding generous Hector, stern began.<span class="lnm">555</span></p>
<p>Where is thy courage, Hector? for thou once<br />
Hadst courage. Is it fled? In other days<br />
Thy boast hath been that without native troops<br />
Or foreign aids, thy kindred and thyself<br />
Alone, were guard sufficient for the town.<span class="lnm">560</span><br />
But none of all thy kindred now appears;<br />
I can discover none; they stand aloof<br />
Quaking, as dogs that hear the lion's roar.<br />
We bear the stress, who are but Troy's allies;<br />
Myself am such, and from afar I came;<span class="lnm">565</span><br />
For Lycia lies far distant on the banks<br />
Of the deep-eddied Xanthus. There a wife<br />
I left and infant son, both dear to me,<br />
With plenteous wealth, the wish of all who want.<br />
Yet urge I still my Lycians, and am prompt<span class="lnm">570</span><br />
Myself to fight, although possessing here<br />
Nought that the Greeks can carry or drive hence.<br />
But there stand'st thou, neither employed thyself,<br />
Nor moving others to an active part<br />
For all their dearest pledges. Oh beware!<span class="lnm">575</span><br />
Lest, as with meshes of an ample net,<br />
At one huge draught the Grecians sweep you all,<br />
And desolate at once your populous Troy!<br />
By day, by night, thoughts such as these should still<br />
Thy conduct influence, and from Chief to Chief<span class="lnm">580</span><br />
Of the allies should send thee, praying each<br />
To make firm stand, all bickerings put away.</p>
<p>So spake Sarpedon, and his reprimand<br />
Stung Hector; instant to the ground he leap'd<br />
All arm'd, and shaking his bright spears his host<span class="lnm">585</span><br />
Ranged in all quarters animating loud<br />
His legions, and rekindling horrid war.<br />
Then, rolling back, the powers of Troy opposed<br />
Once more the Grecians, whom the Grecians dense<br />
Expected, unretreating, void of fear.<span class="lnm">590</span></p>
<p>As flies the chaff wide scatter'd by the wind<br />
<span class="pgnm">124</span><a name="page_124" id="page_124"></a>
O'er all the consecrated floor, what time<br />
Ripe Ceres<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_5-13">[13]</a> with brisk airs her golden grain<br />
Ventilates, whitening with its husk the ground;<br />
So grew the Achaians white, a dusty cloud<span class="lnm">595</span><br />
Descending on their arms, which steeds with steeds<br />
Again to battle mingling, with their hoofs<br />
Up-stamp'd into the brazen vault of heaven;<br />
For now the charioteers turn'd all to fight.<br />
Host toward host with full collected force<span class="lnm">600</span><br />
They moved direct. Then Mars through all the field<br />
Took wide his range, and overhung the war<br />
With night, in aid of Troy, at the command<br />
Of Ph&oelig;bus of the golden sword; for he<br />
Perceiving Pallas from the field withdrawn,<span class="lnm">605</span><br />
Patroness of the Greeks, had Mars enjoin'd<br />
To rouse the spirit of the Trojan host.<br />
Meantime Apollo from his unctuous shrine<br />
Sent forth restored and with new force inspired<br />
&AElig;neas. He amidst his warriors stood,<span class="lnm">610</span><br />
Who him with joy beheld still living, heal'd,<br />
And all his strength possessing unimpair'd.<br />
Yet no man ask'd him aught. No leisure now<br />
For question was; far other thoughts had they;<br />
Such toils the archer of the silver bow,<span class="lnm">615</span><br />
Wide-slaughtering Mars, and Discord as at first<br />
Raging implacable, for them prepared.</p>
<p>Ulysses, either Ajax, Diomede&mdash;<br />
These roused the Greeks to battle, who themselves<br />
The force fear'd nothing, or the shouts of Troy,<span class="lnm">620</span><br />
But steadfast stood, like clouds by Jove amass'd<br />
On lofty mountains, while the fury sleeps<br />
<span class="pgnm">125</span><a name="page_125" id="page_125"></a>
Of Boreas, and of all the stormy winds<br />
Shrill-voiced, that chase the vapors when they blow,<br />
So stood the Greeks, expecting firm the approach<span class="lnm">625</span><br />
Of Ilium's powers, and neither fled nor fear'd.</p>
<p>Then Agamemnon the embattled host<br />
On all sides ranging, cheer'd them. Now, he cried,<br />
Be steadfast, fellow warriors, now be men!<br />
Hold fast a sense of honor. More escape<span class="lnm">630</span><br />
Of men who fear disgrace, than fall in fight,<br />
While dastards forfeit life and glory both.</p>
<p>He said, and hurl'd his spear. He pierced a friend<br />
Of brave &AElig;neas, warring in the van,<br />
Deic&ouml;on son of Pergasus, in Troy<span class="lnm">635</span><br />
Not less esteem'd than Priam's sons themselves,<br />
Such was his fame in foremost fight acquired.<br />
Him Agamemnon on his buckler smote,<br />
Nor stayed the weapon there, but through his belt<br />
His bowels enter'd, and with hideous clang<span class="lnm">640</span><br />
And outcry<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_5-14">[14]</a> of his batter'd arms he fell.</p>
<p>&AElig;neas next two mightiest warriors slew,<br />
Sons of Diocles, of a wealthy sire,<br />
Whose house magnificent in Ph&aelig;r&aelig; stood,<br />
Orsilochus and Crethon. Their descent<span class="lnm">645</span><br />
From broad-stream'd Alpheus, Pylian flood, they drew.<br />
Alpheus begat Orsilochus, a prince<br />
Of numerous powers. Orsilochus begat<br />
Warlike Diodes. From Diodes sprang<br />
Twins, Crethon and Orsilochus, alike<span class="lnm">650</span><br />
Valiant, and skilful in all forms of war.<br />
Their boyish prime scarce past, they, with the Greeks<br />
Embarking, in their sable ships had sail'd<br />
To steed-fam'd Ilium; just revenge they sought<br />
For Atreus' sons, but perished first themselves.<span class="lnm">655</span></p>
<p>As two young lions, in the deep recess<br />
Of some dark forest on the mountain's brow<br />
Late nourished by their dam, forth-issuing, seize<br />
<span class="pgnm">126</span><a name="page_126" id="page_126"></a>
The fatted flocks and kine, both folds and stalls<br />
Wasting rapacious, till, at length, themselves<span class="lnm">660</span><br />
Deep-wounded perish by the hand of man,<br />
So they, both vanquish'd by &AElig;neas, fell,<br />
And like two lofty pines uprooted, lay.<br />
Them fallen in battle Menelaus saw<br />
With pity moved; radiant in arms he shook<span class="lnm">665</span><br />
His brazen spear, and strode into the van.<br />
Mars urged him furious on, conceiving hope<br />
Of his death also by &AElig;neas' hand.</p>
<p>But him the son of generous Nestor mark'd<br />
Antilochus, and to the foremost fight<span class="lnm">670</span><br />
Flew also, fearing lest some dire mischance<br />
The Prince befalling, at one fatal stroke<br />
Should frustrate all the labors of the Greeks.<br />
They, hand to hand, and spear to spear opposed,<br />
Stood threatening dreadful onset, when beside<span class="lnm">675</span><br />
The Spartan chief Antilochus appear'd.<br />
&AElig;neas, at the sight of two combined,<br />
Stood not, although intrepid. They the dead<br />
Thence drawing far into the Grecian host<br />
To their associates gave the hapless pair,<span class="lnm">680</span><br />
Then, both returning, fought in front again.</p>
<p>Next, fierce as Mars, Pyl&aelig;menes they slew,<br />
Prince of the shielded band magnanimous<br />
Of Paphlagonia. Him Atrides kill'd<br />
Spear-practised Menelaus, with a lance<span class="lnm">685</span><br />
His throat transpiercing while erect he rode.<br />
Then, while his charioteer, Mydon the brave,<br />
Son of Atymnias, turn'd his steeds to flight,<br />
Full on his elbow-point Antilochus,<br />
The son of Nestor, dash'd him with a stone.<span class="lnm">690</span><br />
The slack reins, white as ivory,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_5-15">[15]</a> forsook<br />
His torpid hand and trail'd the dust. At once<br />
Forth sprang Antilochus, and with his sword<br />
Hew'd deep his temples. On his head he pitch'd<br />
<span class="pgnm">127</span><a name="page_127" id="page_127"></a>
Panting, and on his shoulders in the sand<span class="lnm">695</span><br />
(For in deep sand he fell) stood long erect,<br />
Till his own coursers spread him in the dust;<br />
The son of Nestor seized, and with his scourge<br />
Drove them afar into the host of Greece.</p>
<p>Them Hector through the ranks espying, flew<span class="lnm">700</span><br />
With clamor loud to meet them; after whom<br />
Advanced in phalanx firm the powers of Troy,<br />
Mars led them, with Enyo terror-clad;<br />
She by the maddening tumult of the fight<br />
Attended, he, with his enormous spear<span class="lnm">705</span><br />
in both hands brandish'd, stalking now in front<br />
Of Hector, and now following his steps.</p>
<p>Him Diomede the bold discerning, felt<br />
Himself no small dismay; and as a man<br />
Wandering he knows not whither, far from home,<span class="lnm">710</span><br />
If chance a rapid torrent to the sea<br />
Borne headlong thwart his course, the foaming flood<br />
Obstreperous views awhile, then quick retires,<br />
So he, and his attendants thus bespake.</p>
<p>How oft, my countrymen! have we admired<span class="lnm">715</span><br />
The noble Hector, skillful at the spear<br />
And unappall'd in fight? but still hath he<br />
Some God his guard, and even now I view<br />
In human form Mars moving at his side.<br />
Ye, then, with faces to the Trojans turn'd,<span class="lnm">720</span><br />
Ceaseless retire, and war not with the Gods.</p>
<p>He ended; and the Trojans now approach'd.<br />
Then two bold warriors in one chariot borne,<br />
By valiant Hector died, Menesthes one,<br />
And one, Anchialus. Them fallen in fight<span class="lnm">725</span><br />
Ajax the vast, touch'd with compassion saw;<br />
Within small space he stood, his glittering spear<br />
Dismiss'd, and pierced Amphius. Son was he<br />
Of Selagus, and P&aelig;sus was his home,<br />
Where opulent he dwelt, but by his fate<span class="lnm">730</span><br />
Was led to fight for Priam and his sons.<br />
Him Telamonian Ajax through his belt<br />
<span class="pgnm">128</span><a name="page_128" id="page_128"></a>
Wounded, and in his nether bowels deep<br />
Fix'd his long-shadow'd spear. Sounding he fell.<br />
Illustrious Ajax running to the slain<span class="lnm">735</span><br />
Prepared to strip his arms, but him a shower<br />
Of glittering-weapons keen from Trojan hands<br />
Assail'd, and numerous his broad shield received.<br />
He, on the body planting firm his heel,<br />
Forth drew the polish'd spear, but his bright arms<span class="lnm">740</span><br />
Took not, by darts thick-flying sore annoy'd,<br />
Nor fear'd he little lest his haughty foes,<br />
Spear-arm'd and bold, should compass him around;<br />
Him, therefore, valiant though he were and huge,<br />
They push'd before them. Staggering he retired.<span class="lnm">745</span></p>
<p>Thus toil'd both hosts in that laborious field.<br />
And now his ruthless destiny impell'd<br />
Tlepolemus, Alcides' son, a Chief<br />
Dauntless and huge, against a godlike foe<br />
Sarpedon. They approaching face to face<span class="lnm">750</span><br />
Stood, son and grandson of high-thundering Jove,<br />
And, haughty, thus Tlepolemus began.</p>
<p>Sarpedon, leader of the Lycian host,<br />
Thou trembler! thee what cause could hither urge<br />
A man unskill'd in arms? They falsely speak<span class="lnm">755</span><br />
Who call thee son of &AElig;gis-bearing Jove,<br />
So far below their might thou fall'st who sprang<br />
From Jove in days of old. What says report<br />
Of Hercules (for him I boast my sire)<br />
All-daring hero with a lion's heart?<span class="lnm">760</span><br />
With six ships only, and with followers few,<br />
He for the horses of Laomedon<br />
Lay'd Troy in dust, and widow'd all her streets.<br />
But thou art base, and thy diminish'd powers<br />
Perish around thee; think not that thou earnest<span class="lnm">765</span><br />
For Ilium's good, but rather, whatsoe'er<br />
Thy force in fight, to find, subdued by me,<br />
A sure dismission to the gates of hell.</p>
<p>To whom the leader of the Lycian band.<br />
Tlepolemus! he ransack'd sacred Troy,<span class="lnm">770</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">129</span><a name="page_129" id="page_129"></a>
As thou hast said, but for her monarch's fault<br />
Laomedon, who him with language harsh<br />
Requited ill for benefits received,<br />
Nor would the steeds surrender, seeking which<br />
He voyaged from afar. But thou shalt take<span class="lnm">775</span><br />
Thy bloody doom from this victorious arm,<br />
And, vanquish'd by my spear, shalt yield thy fame<br />
To me, thy soul to Pluto steed-renown'd.</p>
<p>So spake Sarpedon, and his ashen beam<br />
Tlepolemus upraised. Both hurl'd at once<span class="lnm">780</span><br />
Their quivering spears. Sarpedon's through the neck<br />
Pass'd of Tlepolemus, and show'd beyond<br />
Its ruthless point; thick darkness veil'd his eyes.<br />
Tlepolemus with his long lance the thigh<br />
Pierced of Sarpedon; sheer into his bone<span class="lnm">785</span><br />
He pierced him, but Sarpedon's father, Jove,<br />
Him rescued even on the verge of fate.</p>
<p>His noble friends conducted from the field<br />
The godlike Lycian, trailing as he went<br />
The pendent spear, none thinking to extract<span class="lnm">790</span><br />
For his relief the weapon from his thigh,<br />
Through eagerness of haste to bear him thence.<br />
On the other side, the Grecians brazen-mail'd<br />
Bore off Tlepolemus. Ulysses fill'd<br />
With earnest thoughts tumultuous them observed,<span class="lnm">795</span><br />
Danger-defying Chief! Doubtful he stood<br />
Or to pursue at once the Thunderer's son<br />
Sarpedon, or to take more Lycian lives.<br />
But not for brave Ulysses had his fate<br />
That praise reserved, that he should slay the son<span class="lnm">800</span><br />
Renown'd of Jove; therefore his wavering mind<br />
Minerva bent against the Lycian band.<br />
Then C&oelig;ranus, Alastor, Chromius fell,<br />
Alcander, Halius, Prytanis, and brave<br />
No&euml;mon; nor had these sufficed the Chief<span class="lnm">805</span><br />
Of Ithaca, but Lycians more had fallen,<br />
Had not crest-tossing Hector huge perceived<br />
The havoc; radiant to the van he flew,<br />
<span class="pgnm">130</span><a name="page_130" id="page_130"></a>
Filling with dread the Grecians; his approach<br />
Sarpedon, son of Jove, joyful beheld,<span class="lnm">810</span><br />
And piteous thus address'd him as he came.</p>
<p>Ah, leave not me, Priamides! a prey<br />
To Grecian hands, but in your city, at least,<br />
Grant me to die: since hither, doom'd, I came<br />
Never to gratify with my return<span class="lnm">815</span><br />
To Lycia, my loved spouse, or infant child.</p>
<p>He spake; but Hector unreplying pass'd<br />
Impetuous, ardent to repulse the Greeks<br />
That moment, and to drench his sword in blood.<br />
Then, under shelter of a spreading beech<span class="lnm">820</span><br />
Sacred to Jove, his noble followers placed<br />
The godlike Chief Sarpedon, where his friend<br />
Illustrious Pelagon, the ashen spear<br />
Extracted. Sightless, of all thought bereft,<br />
He sank, but soon revived, by breathing airs<span class="lnm">825</span><br />
Refresh'd, that fann'd him gently from the North.</p>
<p>Meantime the Argives, although press'd alike<br />
By Mars himself and Hector brazen-arm'd,<br />
Neither to flight inclined, nor yet advanced<br />
To battle, but inform'd that Mars the fight<span class="lnm">830</span><br />
Waged on the side of Ilium, slow retired.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_5-16">[16]</a></p>
<p>Whom first, whom last slew then the mighty son<br />
Of Priam, Hector, and the brazen Mars!<br />
First godlike Teuthras, an equestrian Chief,<br />
Orestes, Trechus of &AElig;tolian race,<span class="lnm">835</span><br />
&OElig;noma&uuml;s, Helenus from &OElig;nops' sprung,<br />
And brisk<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_5-17">[17]</a> in fight Oresbius; rich was he,<br />
And covetous of more; in Hyla dwelt<br />
<span class="pgnm">131</span><a name="page_131" id="page_131"></a>
Fast by the lake Cephissus, where abode<br />
B&oelig;otian Princes numerous, rich themselves<span class="lnm">840</span><br />
And rulers of a people wealth-renown'd.<br />
But Juno, such dread slaughter of the Greeks<br />
Noting, thus, ardent, to Minerva spake.</p>
<p>Daughter of Jove invincible! Our word<br />
That Troy shall perish, hath been given in vain<span class="lnm">845</span><br />
To Menelaus, if we suffer Mars<br />
To ravage longer uncontrol'd. The time<br />
Urges, and need appears that we ourselves<br />
Now call to mind the fury of our might.</p>
<p>She spake; nor blue-eyed Pallas not complied.<span class="lnm">850</span><br />
Then Juno, Goddess dread, from Saturn sprung,<br />
Her coursers gold-caparison'd prepared<br />
Impatient. Hebe to the chariot roll'd<br />
The brazen wheels,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_5-18">[18]</a> and joined them to the smooth<br />
Steel axle; twice four spokes divided each<span class="lnm">855</span><br />
Shot from the centre to the verge. The verge<br />
Was gold by fellies of eternal brass<br />
Guarded, a dazzling show! The shining naves<br />
Were silver; silver cords and cords of gold<br />
The seat upbore; two crescents<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_5-19">[19]</a> blazed in front.<span class="lnm">860</span><br />
The pole was argent all, to which she bound<br />
The golden yoke, and in their place disposed<br />
The breast-bands incorruptible of gold;<br />
But Juno to the yoke, herself, the steeds<br />
Led forth, on fire to reach the dreadful field.<span class="lnm">865</span></p>
<p>Meantime, Minerva, progeny of Jove,<br />
On the adamantine floor of his abode<br />
<span class="pgnm">132</span><a name="page_132" id="page_132"></a>
Let fall profuse her variegated robe,<br />
Labor of her own hands. She first put on<br />
The corselet of the cloud-assembler God,<span class="lnm">870</span><br />
Then arm'd her for the field of wo complete.<br />
She charged her shoulder with the dreadful shield<br />
The shaggy &AElig;gis,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_5-20">[20]</a> border'd thick around<br />
With terror; there was Discord, Prowess there,<br />
There hot Pursuit, and there the feature grim<span class="lnm">875</span><br />
Of Gorgon, dire Deformity, a sign<br />
Oft borne portentous on the arm of Jove.<br />
Her golden helm, whose concave had sufficed<br />
The legions of an hundred cities, rough<br />
With warlike ornament superb, she fix'd<span class="lnm">880</span><br />
On her immortal head. Thus arm'd, she rose<br />
Into the flaming chariot, and her spear<br />
Seized ponderous, huge, with which the Goddess sprung<br />
From an Almighty father, levels ranks<br />
Of heroes, against whom her anger burns.<span class="lnm">885</span><br />
Juno with lifted lash urged quick the steeds;<br />
At her approach, spontaneous roar'd the wide-<br />
Unfolding gates of heaven;<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_5-21">[21]</a> the heavenly gates<br />
Kept by the watchful Hours, to whom the charge<br />
Of the Olympian summit appertains,<span class="lnm">890</span><br />
And of the boundless ether, back to roll,<br />
And to replace the cloudy barrier dense.<br />
Spurr'd through the portal flew the rapid steeds;<br />
Apart from all, and seated on the point<br />
Superior of the cloven mount, they found<span class="lnm">895</span><br />
The Thunderer. Juno the white-arm'd her steeds<br />
There stay'd, and thus the Goddess, ere she pass'd,<br />
Question'd the son of Saturn, Jove supreme.</p>
<p>Jove, Father, seest thou, and art not incensed,<br />
These ravages of Mars? Oh what a field,<span class="lnm">900</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">133</span><a name="page_133" id="page_133"></a>
Drench'd with what Grecian blood! All rashly spilt,<br />
And in despite of me. Venus, the while,<br />
Sits, and the Archer of the silver bow<br />
Delighted, and have urged, themselves, to this<br />
The frantic Mars within no bounds confined<span class="lnm">905</span><br />
Of law or order. But, eternal sire!<br />
Shall I offend thee chasing far away<br />
Mars deeply smitten from the field of war?</p>
<p>To whom the cloud-assembler God replied.<br />
Go! but exhort thou rather to the task<span class="lnm">910</span><br />
Spoil-huntress Athen&aelig;an Pallas, him<br />
Accustom'd to chastise with pain severe.</p>
<p>He spake, nor white-arm'd Juno not obey'd.<br />
She lash'd her steeds; they readily their flight<br />
Began, the earth and starry vault between.<span class="lnm">915</span><br />
Far as from his high tower the watchman kens<br />
O'er gloomy ocean, so far at one bound<br />
Advance the shrill-voiced coursers of the Gods.<br />
But when at Troy and at the confluent streams<br />
Of Simo&iuml;s and Scamander they arrived,<span class="lnm">920</span><br />
There Juno, white-arm'd Goddess, from the yoke<br />
Her steeds releasing, them in gather'd shades<br />
Conceal'd opaque, while Simo&iuml;s caused to spring<br />
Ambrosia from his bank, whereon they browsed.</p>
<p>Swift as her pinions waft the dove away<span class="lnm">925</span><br />
They sought the Grecians, ardent to begin:<br />
Arriving where the mightiest and the most<br />
Compass'd equestrian Diomede around,<br />
In aspect lion-like, or like wild boars<br />
Of matchless force, there white-arm'd Juno stood,<span class="lnm">930</span><br />
And in the form of Stentor for his voice<br />
Of brass renown'd, audible as the roar<br />
Of fifty throats, the Grecians thus harangued.</p>
<p>Oh shame, shame, shame! Argives in form alone,<br />
Beautiful but dishonorable race!<span class="lnm">935</span><br />
While yet divine Achilles ranged the field,<br />
No Trojan stepp'd from yon Dardanian gates<br />
Abroad; all trembled at his stormy spear;<br />
<span class="pgnm">134</span><a name="page_134" id="page_134"></a>
But now they venture forth, now at your ships<br />
Defy you, from their city far remote.<span class="lnm">940</span></p>
<p>She ceased, and all caught courage from the sound.<br />
But Athen&aelig;an Pallas eager sought<br />
The son of Tydeus; at his chariot side<br />
She found the Chief cooling his fiery wound<br />
Received from Pandarus; for him the sweat<span class="lnm">945</span><br />
Beneath the broad band of his oval shield<br />
Exhausted, and his arm fail'd him fatigued;<br />
He therefore raised the band and wiped the blood<br />
Coagulate; when o'er his chariot yoke<br />
Her arm the Goddess threw, and thus began.<span class="lnm">950</span></p>
<p>Tydeus, in truth, begat a son himself<br />
Not much resembling. Tydeus was of size<br />
Diminutive, but had a warrior's heart.<br />
When him I once commanded to abstain<br />
From furious fight (what time he enter'd Thebes<span class="lnm">955</span><br />
Ambassador, and the Cadmeans found<br />
Feasting, himself the sole Achaian there)<br />
And bade him quietly partake the feast.<br />
He, fired with wonted ardor, challenged forth<br />
To proof of manhood the Cadmean youth,<span class="lnm">960</span><br />
Whom easily, through my effectual aid,<br />
In contests of each kind he overcame.<br />
But thou, whom I encircle with my power,<br />
Guard vigilant, and even bid thee forth<br />
To combat with the Trojans, thou, thy limbs<span class="lnm">965</span><br />
Feel'st wearied with the toils of war, or worse,<br />
Indulgest womanish and heartless fear.<br />
Henceforth thou art not worthy to be deem'd<br />
Son of Oenides, Tydeus famed in arms.</p>
<p>To whom thus valiant Diomede replied.<span class="lnm">970</span><br />
I know thee well, oh Goddess sprung from Jove!<br />
And therefore willing shall, and plain, reply.<br />
Me neither weariness nor heartless fear<br />
Restrains, but thine injunctions which impress<br />
My memory, still, that I should fear to oppose<span class="lnm">975</span><br />
The blessed Gods in fight, Venus except,<br />
<span class="pgnm">135</span><a name="page_135" id="page_135"></a>
Whom in the battle found thou badest me pierce<br />
With unrelenting spear; therefore myself<br />
Retiring hither, I have hither call'd<br />
The other Argives also, for I know<span class="lnm">980</span><br />
That Mars, himself in arms, controls the war.</p>
<p>Him answer'd then the Goddess azure-eyed.<br />
Tydides! Diomede, my heart's delight!<br />
Fear not this Mars,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_5-22">[22]</a> nor fear thou other power<br />
Immortal, but be confident in me.<span class="lnm">985</span><br />
Arise. Drive forth. Seek Mars; him only seek;<br />
Him hand to hand engage; this fiery Mars<br />
Respect not aught, base implement of wrong<br />
And mischief, shifting still from side to side.<br />
He promised Juno lately and myself<span class="lnm">990</span><br />
That he would fight for Greece, yet now forgets<br />
His promise, and gives all his aid to Troy.</p>
<p>So saying, she backward by his hand withdrew<br />
The son of Capaneus, who to the ground<br />
Leap'd instant; she, impatient to his place<span class="lnm">995</span><br />
Ascending, sat beside brave Diomede.<br />
Loud groan'd the beechen axle, under weight<br />
Unwonted, for it bore into the fight<br />
An awful Goddess, and the chief of men.<br />
Quick-seizing lash and reins Minerva drove<span class="lnm">1000</span><br />
Direct at Mars. That moment he had slain<br />
Periphas, bravest of &AElig;tolia's sons,<br />
And huge of bulk; Ochesius was his sire.<br />
Him Mars the slaughterer had of life bereft<br />
Newly, and Pallas to elude his sight<span class="lnm">1005</span><br />
The helmet fixed of Ades on her head.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_5-23">[23]</a><br />
Soon as gore-tainted Mars the approach perceived<br />
Of Diomede, he left the giant length<br />
Of Periphas extended where he died,<br />
And flew to cope with Tydeus' valiant son.<span class="lnm">1010</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">136</span><a name="page_136" id="page_136"></a>
Full nigh they came, when Mars on fire to slay<br />
The hero, foremost with his brazen lance<br />
Assail'd him, hurling o'er his horses' heads.<br />
But Athen&aelig;an Pallas in her hand<br />
The flying weapon caught and turn'd it wide,<span class="lnm">1015</span><br />
Baffling his aim. Then Diomede on him<br />
Rush'd furious in his turn, and Pallas plunged<br />
The bright spear deep into his cinctured waist<br />
Dire was the wound, and plucking back the spear<br />
She tore him. Bellow'd brazen-throated Mars<span class="lnm">1020</span><br />
Loud as nine thousand warriors, or as ten<br />
Join'd in close combat. Grecians, Trojans shook<br />
Appall'd alike at the tremendous voice<br />
Of Mars insatiable with deeds of blood.<br />
Such as the dimness is when summer winds<span class="lnm">1025</span><br />
Breathe hot, and sultry mist obscures the sky,<br />
Such brazen Mars to Diomede appear'd<br />
By clouds accompanied in his ascent<br />
Into the boundless ether. Reaching soon<br />
The Olympian heights, seat of the Gods, he sat<span class="lnm">1030</span><br />
Beside Saturnian Jove; wo fill'd his heart;<br />
He show'd fast-streaming from the wound his blood<br />
Immortal, and impatient thus complain'd.</p>
<p>Jove, Father! Seest thou these outrageous acts<br />
Unmoved with anger? Such are day by day<span class="lnm">1035</span><br />
The dreadful mischiefs by the Gods contrived<br />
Against each other, for the sake of man.<br />
Thou art thyself the cause. Thou hast produced<br />
A foolish daughter petulant, addict<br />
To evil only and injurious deeds;<span class="lnm">1040</span><br />
There is not in Olympus, save herself,<br />
Who feels not thy control; but she her will<br />
Gratifies ever, and reproof from thee<br />
Finds none, because, pernicious as she is,<br />
She is thy daughter. She hath now the mind<span class="lnm">1045</span><br />
Of haughty Diomede with madness fill'd<br />
Against the immortal Gods; first Venus bled;<br />
Her hand he pierced impetuous, then assail'd,<br />
<span class="pgnm">137</span><a name="page_137" id="page_137"></a>
As if himself immortal, even me,<br />
But me my feet stole thence, or overwhelm'd<span class="lnm">1050</span><br />
Beneath yon heaps of carcases impure,<br />
What had I not sustain'd? And if at last<br />
I lived, had halted crippled by the sword.</p>
<p>To whom with dark displeasure Jove replied.<br />
Base and side-shifting traitor! vex not me<span class="lnm">1055</span><br />
Here sitting querulous; of all who dwell<br />
On the Olympian heights, thee most I hate<br />
Contentious, whose delight is war alone.<br />
Thou hast thy mother's moods, the very spleen<br />
Of Juno, uncontrolable as she.<span class="lnm">1060</span><br />
Whom even I, reprove her as I may,<br />
Scarce rule by mere commands; I therefore judge<br />
Thy sufferings a contrivance all her own.<br />
But soft. Thou art my son whom I begat.<br />
And Juno bare thee. I can not endure<span class="lnm">1065</span><br />
That thou shouldst suffer long. Hadst thou been born<br />
Of other parents thus detestable,<br />
What Deity soe'er had brought thee forth,<br />
Thou shouldst have found long since a humbler sphere.</p>
<p>He ceased, and to the care his son consign'd<span class="lnm">1070</span><br />
Of P&aelig;on; he with drugs of lenient powers,<br />
Soon heal'd whom immortality secured<br />
From dissolution. As the juice from figs<br />
Express'd what fluid was in milk before<br />
Coagulates, stirr'd rapidly around,<span class="lnm">1075</span><br />
So soon was Mars by P&aelig;on skill restored.<br />
Him Hebe bathed, and with divine attire<br />
Graceful adorn'd; when at the side of Jove<br />
Again his glorious seat sublime he took.</p>
<p>Meantime to the abode of Jove supreme<span class="lnm">1080</span><br />
Ascended Juno throughout Argos known<br />
And mighty Pallas; Mars the plague of man,<br />
By their successful force from slaughter driven.</p>

<p class="outd">The battle is continued. The Trojans being closely pursued, Hector by the
advice of Helenus enters Troy, and recommends it to Hecuba to go in
solemn procession to the temple of Minerva; she with the matrons goes
accordingly. Hector takes the opportunity to find out Paris, and exhorts
him to return to the field of battle. An interview succeeds between Hector
and Andromache, and Paris, having armed himself in the mean time,
comes up with Hector at the close of it, when they sally from the gate together.</p>

With martial ardor, Menelaus seized<br />
And took alive Adrastus. As it chanced<br />
A thicket his affrighted steeds detain'd<br />
Their feet entangling; they with restive force<br />
At its extremity snapp'd short the pole,<span class="lnm">50</span><br />
And to the city, whither others fled,<br />
Fled also. From his chariot headlong hurl'd,<br />
Adrastus press'd the plain fast by his wheel.<br />
<span class="pgnm">143</span><a name="page_143" id="page_143"></a>
Flew Menelaus, and his quivering spear<br />
Shook over him; he, life imploring, clasp'd<span class="lnm">55</span><br />
Importunate his knees, and thus exclaim'd.</p>
<p>Oh, son of Atreus, let me live! accept<br />
Illustrious ransom! In my father's house<br />
Is wealth abundant, gold, and brass, and steel<br />
Of truest temper, which he will impart<span class="lnm">60</span><br />
Till he have gratified thine utmost wish,<br />
Inform'd that I am captive in your fleet.</p>
<p>He said, and Menelaus by his words<br />
Vanquish'd, him soon had to the fleet dismiss'd<br />
Given to his train in charge, but swift and stern<span class="lnm">65</span><br />
Approaching, Agamemnon interposed.</p>
<p>Now, brother, whence this milkiness of mind,<br />
These scruples about blood? Thy Trojan friends<br />
Have doubtless much obliged thee. Die the race!<br />
May none escape us! neither he who flies,<span class="lnm">70</span><br />
Nor even the infant in his mother's womb<br />
Unconscious. Perish universal Troy<br />
Unpitied, till her place be found no more!<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_6-5">[5]</a></p>
<p>So saying, his brother's mind the Hero turn'd,<br />
Advising him aright; he with his hand<span class="lnm">75</span><br />
Thrust back Adrastus, and himself, the King,<br />
His bowels pierced. Supine Adrastus fell,<br />
And Agamemnon, with his foot the corse<br />
Impressing firm, pluck'd forth his ashen spear.<br />
Then Nestor, raising high his voice, exclaim'd.<span class="lnm">80</span></p>
<p>Friends, Heroes, Grecians, ministers of Mars!<br />
Let none, desirous of the spoil, his time<br />
Devote to plunder now; now slay your foes,<br />
And strip them when the field shall be your own.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_6-6">[6]</a></p>
<p><span class="pgnm">144</span><a name="page_144" id="page_144"></a>
He said, and all took courage at his word.<span class="lnm">85</span></p>
<p>Then had the Trojans enter'd Troy again<br />
By the heroic Grecians foul repulsed,<br />
So was their spirit daunted, but the son<br />
Of Priam, Helenus, an augur far<br />
Excelling all, at Hector's side his speech<span class="lnm">90</span><br />
To him and to &AElig;neas thus address'd.</p>
<p>Hector, and thou, &AElig;neas, since on you<br />
The Lycians chiefly and ourselves depend,<br />
For that in difficult emprize ye show<br />
Most courage; give best counsel; stand yourselves,<span class="lnm">95</span><br />
And, visiting all quarters, cause to stand<br />
Before the city-gates our scatter'd troops,<br />
Ere yet the fugitives within the arms<br />
Be slaughter'd of their wives, the scorn of Greece.<br />
When thus ye shall have rallied every band<span class="lnm">100</span><br />
And roused their courage, weary though we be,<br />
Yet since necessity commands, even here<br />
Will we give battle to the host of Greece.<br />
But, Hector! to the city thou depart;<br />
There charge our mother, that she go direct,<span class="lnm">105</span><br />
With the assembled matrons, to the fane<br />
Of Pallas in the citadel of Troy.<br />
Opening her chambers' sacred doors, of all<br />
Her treasured mantles there, let her select<br />
The widest, most magnificently wrought,<span class="lnm">110</span><br />
And which she values most; <i>that</i> let her spread<br />
On Athen&aelig;an Pallas' lap divine.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_6-7">[7]</a><br />
Twelve heifers of the year yet never touch'd<br />
With puncture of the goad, let her alike<br />
Devote to her, if she will pity Troy,<span class="lnm">115</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">145</span><a name="page_145" id="page_145"></a>
Our wives and little ones, and will avert<br />
The son of Tydeus from these sacred towers,<br />
That dreadful Chief, terror of all our host,<br />
Bravest, in my account, of all the Greeks.<br />
For never yet Achilles hath himself<span class="lnm">120</span><br />
So taught our people fear, although esteemed<br />
Son of a Goddess. But this warrior's rage<br />
Is boundless, and his strength past all compare.</p>
<p>So Helenus; nor Hector not complied.<br />
Down from his chariot instant to the ground<span class="lnm">125</span><br />
All arm'd he leap'd, and, shaking his sharp spears,<br />
Through every phalanx pass'd, rousing again<br />
Their courage, and rekindling horrid war.<br />
They, turning, faced the Greeks; the Greeks repulsed,<br />
Ceased from all carnage, nor supposed they less<span class="lnm">130</span><br />
Than that some Deity, the starry skies<br />
Forsaken, help'd their foes, so firm they stood.<br />
But Hector to the Trojans call'd aloud.<br />
Ye dauntless Trojans and confederate powers<br />
Call'd from afar! now be ye men, my friends,<span class="lnm">135</span><br />
Now summon all the fury of your might!<br />
I go to charge our senators and wives<br />
That they address the Gods with prayers and vows<br />
For our success, and hecatombs devote.</p>
<p>So saying the Hero went, and as he strode<span class="lnm">140</span><br />
The sable hide that lined his bossy shield<br />
Smote on his neck and on his ancle-bone.</p>
<p>And now into the middle space between<br />
Both hosts, the son of Tydeus and the son<br />
Moved of Hippolochus, intent alike<span class="lnm">145</span><br />
On furious combat; face to face they stood,<br />
And thus heroic Diomede began.</p>
<p>Most noble Champion! who of human kind<br />
Art thou,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_6-8">[8]</a> whom in the man-ennobling fight<br />
I now encounter first? Past all thy peers<span class="lnm">150</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">146</span><a name="page_146" id="page_146"></a>
I must esteem thee valiant, who hast dared<br />
To meet my coming, and my spear defy.<br />
Ah! they are sons of miserable sires<br />
Who dare my might; but if a God from heaven<br />
Thou come, behold! I fight not with the Gods.<span class="lnm">155</span><br />
That war Lycurgus son of Dryas waged,<br />
And saw not many years. The nurses he<br />
Of brain-disturbing Bacchus down the steep<br />
Pursued of sacred Nyssa; they their wands<br />
Vine-wreathed cast all away, with an ox-goad<span class="lnm">160</span><br />
Chastised by fell Lycurgus. Bacchus plunged<br />
Meantime dismay'd into the deep, where him<br />
Trembling, and at the Hero's haughty threats<br />
Confounded, Thetis in her bosom hid.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_6-9">[9]</a><br />
Thus by Lycurgus were the blessed powers<span class="lnm">165</span><br />
Of heaven offended, and Saturnian Jove<br />
Of sight bereaved him, who not long that loss<br />
Survived, for he was curst by all above.<br />
I, therefore, wage no contest with the Gods;<br />
But if thou be of men, and feed on bread<span class="lnm">170</span><br />
Of earthly growth, draw nigh, that with a stroke<br />
Well-aim'd, I may at once cut short thy days.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_6-10">[10]</a></p>
<p>To whom the illustrious Lycian Chief replied.<br />
Why asks brave Diomede of my descent?<br />
For, as the leaves, such is the race of man.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_6-11">[11]</a><span class="lnm">175</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">147</span><a name="page_147" id="page_147"></a>
The wind shakes down the leaves, the budding grove<br />
Soon teems with others, and in spring they grow.<br />
So pass mankind. One generation meets<br />
Its destined period, and a new succeeds.<br />
But since thou seem'st desirous to be taught<span class="lnm">180</span><br />
My pedigree, whereof no few have heard,<br />
Know that in Argos, in the very lap<br />
Of Argos, for her steed-grazed meadows famed,<br />
Stands Ephyra;<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_6-12">[12]</a> there Sisyphus abode,<br />
Shrewdest of human kind; Sisyphus, named<span class="lnm">185</span><br />
&AElig;olides. Himself a son begat,<br />
Glaucus, and he Bellerophon, to whom<br />
The Gods both manly force and beauty gave.<br />
Him Pr&oelig;tus (for in Argos at that time<br />
Pr&oelig;tus was sovereign, to whose sceptre Jove<span class="lnm">190</span><br />
Had subjected the land) plotting his death,<br />
Contrived to banish from his native home.<br />
For fair Anteia, wife of Pr&oelig;tus, mad<br />
Through love of young Bellerophon, him oft<br />
In secret to illicit joys enticed;<span class="lnm">195</span><br />
But she prevail'd not o'er the virtuous mind<br />
Discrete of whom she wooed; therefore a lie<br />
Framing, she royal Pr&oelig;tus thus bespake.</p>
<p>Die thou, or slay Bellerophon, who sought<br />
Of late to force me to his lewd embrace.<span class="lnm">200</span></p>
<p>So saying, the anger of the King she roused.<br />
Slay him himself he would not, for his heart<br />
Forbad the deed; him therefore he dismiss'd<br />
To Lycia, charged with tales of dire import<br />
Written in tablets,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_6-13">[13]</a> which he bade him show,<span class="lnm">205</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">148</span><a name="page_148" id="page_148"></a>
That he might perish, to Anteia's sire.<br />
To Lycia then, conducted by the Gods,<br />
He went, and on the shores of Xanthus found<br />
Free entertainment noble at the hands<br />
Of Lycia's potent King. Nine days complete<span class="lnm">210</span><br />
He feasted him, and slew each day an ox.<br />
But when the tenth day's ruddy morn appear'd,<br />
He asked him then his errand, and to see<br />
Those written tablets from his son-in-law.<br />
The letters seen, he bade him, first, destroy<span class="lnm">215</span><br />
Chim&aelig;ra, deem'd invincible, divine<br />
In nature, alien from the race of man,<br />
Lion in front, but dragon all behind,<br />
And in the midst a she-goat breathing forth<br />
Profuse the violence of flaming fire.<span class="lnm">220</span><br />
Her, confident in signs from heaven, he slew.<br />
Next, with the men of Solym&aelig;<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_6-14">[14]</a> he fought,<br />
Brave warriors far renown'd, with whom he waged,<br />
In his account, the fiercest of his wars.<br />
And lastly, when in battle he had slain<span class="lnm">225</span><br />
The man-resisting Amazons, the king<br />
Another stratagem at his return<br />
Devised against him, placing close-conceal'd<br />
An ambush for him from the bravest chosen<br />
In Lycia; but they saw their homes no more;<span class="lnm">230</span><br />
Bellerophon the valiant slew them all.<br />
The monarch hence collecting, at the last,<br />
His heavenly origin, him there detain'd,<br />
And gave him his own daughter, with the half<br />
Of all his royal dignity and power.<span class="lnm">235</span><br />
The Lycians also, for his proper use,<br />
Large lot assigned him of their richest soil,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_6-15">[15]</a><br />
<span class="pgnm">149</span><a name="page_149" id="page_149"></a>
Commodious for the vine, or for the plow.<br />
And now his consort fair three children bore<br />
To bold Bellerophon; Isandrus one,<span class="lnm">240</span><br />
And one, Hippolochus; his youngest born<br />
Laodamia was for beauty such<br />
That she became a concubine of Jove.<br />
She bore Sarpedon of heroic note.<br />
But when Bellerophon, at last, himself<span class="lnm">245</span><br />
Had anger'd all the Gods, feeding on grief<br />
He roam'd alone the Aleian field, exiled,<br />
By choice, from every cheerful haunt of man.<br />
Mars, thirsty still for blood, his son destroy'd<br />
Isandrus, warring with the host renown'd<span class="lnm">250</span><br />
Of Solym&aelig;; and in her wrath divine<br />
Diana from her chariot golden-rein'd<br />
Laodamia slew. Myself I boast<br />
Sprung from Hippolochus; he sent me forth<br />
To fight for Troy, charging me much and oft<span class="lnm">255</span><br />
That I should outstrip always all mankind<br />
In worth and valor, nor the house disgrace<br />
Of my forefathers, heroes without peer<br />
In Ephyra, and in Lycia's wide domain.<br />
Such is my lineage; such the blood I boast.<span class="lnm">260</span></p>
<p>He ceased. Then valiant Diomede rejoiced.<br />
He pitch'd his spear, and to the Lycian Prince<br />
In terms of peace and amity replied.</p>
<p>Thou art my own hereditary friend,<br />
Whose noble grandsire was the guest of mine.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_6-16">[16]</a><span class="lnm">265</span><br />
For Oeneus, on a time, full twenty days<br />
Regaled Bellerophon, and pledges fair<br />
Of hospitality they interchanged.<br />
<span class="pgnm">150</span><a name="page_150" id="page_150"></a>
Oeneus a belt radiant with purple gave<br />
To brave Bellerophon, who in return<span class="lnm">270</span><br />
Gave him a golden goblet. Coming forth<br />
I left the kind memorial safe at home.<br />
A child was I when Tydeus went to Thebes,<br />
Where the Achaians perish'd, and of him<br />
Hold no remembrance; but henceforth, my friend,<span class="lnm">275</span><br />
Thine host am I in Argos, and thou mine<br />
In Lycia, should I chance to sojourn there.<br />
We will not clash. Trojans or aids of Troy<br />
No few the Gods shall furnish to my spear,<br />
Whom I may slaughter; and no want of Greeks<span class="lnm">280</span><br />
On whom to prove thy prowess, thou shalt find.<br />
But it were well that an exchange ensued<br />
Between us; take mine armor, give me thine,<br />
That all who notice us may understand<br />
Our patrimonial<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_6-17">[17]</a> amity and love.<span class="lnm">285</span></p>
<p>So they, and each alighting, hand in hand<br />
Stood lock'd, faith promising and firm accord.<br />
Then Jove of sober judgment so bereft<br />
Infatuate Glaucus that with Tydeus' son<br />
He barter'd gold for brass, an hundred beeves<span class="lnm">290</span><br />
In value, for the value small of nine.</p>
<p>But Hector at the Sc&aelig;an gate and beech<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_6-18">[18]</a><br />
Meantime arrived, to whose approach the wives<br />
And daughters flock'd of Troy, inquiring each<br />
The fate of husband, brother, son, or friend.<span class="lnm">295</span><br />
He bade them all with solemn prayer the Gods<br />
Seek fervent, for that wo was on the wing.</p>
<p>But when he enter'd Priam's palace, built<br />
With splendid porticoes, and which within<br />
Had fifty chambers lined with polish'd stone,<span class="lnm">300</span><br />
Contiguous all, where Priam's sons reposed<br />
And his sons' wives, and where, on the other side.<br />
<span class="pgnm">151</span><a name="page_151" id="page_151"></a>
In twelve magnificent chambers also lined<br />
With polish'd marble and contiguous all,<br />
The sons-in-law of Priam lay beside<span class="lnm">305</span><br />
His spotless daughters, there the mother queen<br />
Seeking the chamber of Laodice,<br />
Loveliest of all her children, as she went<br />
Met Hector. On his hand she hung and said:</p>
<p>Why leavest thou, O my son! the dangerous field?<span class="lnm">310</span><br />
I fear that the Achaians (hateful name!)<br />
Compass the walls so closely, that thou seek'st<br />
Urged by distress the citadel, to lift<br />
Thine hands in prayer to Jove? But pause awhile<br />
Till I shall bring thee wine, that having pour'd<span class="lnm">315</span><br />
Libation rich to Jove and to the powers<br />
Immortal, thou may'st drink and be refresh'd.<br />
For wine is mighty to renew the strength<br />
Of weary man, and weary thou must be<br />
Thyself, thus long defending us and ours.<span class="lnm">320</span><br />
To whom her son majestic thus replied.</p>
<p>My mother, whom I reverence! cheering wine<br />
Bring none to me, lest I forget my might.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_6-19">[19]</a><br />
I fear, beside, with unwash'd hands to pour<br />
Libation forth of sable wine to Jove,<span class="lnm">325</span><br />
And dare on none account, thus blood-defiled,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_6-20">[20]</a><br />
Approach the tempest-stirring God in prayer.<br />
Thou, therefore, gathering all our matrons, seek<br />
The fane of Pallas, huntress of the spoil,<br />
Bearing sweet incense; but from the attire<span class="lnm">330</span><br />
Treasured within thy chamber, first select<br />
<span class="pgnm">152</span><a name="page_152" id="page_152"></a>
The amplest robe, most exquisitely wrought,<br />
And which thou prizest most&mdash;then spread the gift<br />
On Athen&aelig;an Pallas' lap divine.<br />
Twelve heifers also of the year, untouch'd<span class="lnm">335</span><br />
With puncture of the goad, promise to slay<br />
In sacrifice, if she will pity Troy,<br />
Our wives and little ones, and will avert<br />
The son of Tydeus from these sacred towers,<br />
That dreadful Chief, terror of all our host.<span class="lnm">340</span><br />
Go then, my mother, seek the hallowed fane<br />
Of the spoil-huntress Deity. I, the while,<br />
Seek Paris, and if Paris yet can hear,<br />
Shall call him forth. But oh that earth would yawn<br />
And swallow him, whom Jove hath made a curse<span class="lnm">345</span><br />
To Troy, to Priam, and to all his house;<br />
Methinks, to see him plunged into the shades<br />
For ever, were a cure for all my woes.</p>
<p>He ceased; the Queen, her palace entering, charged<br />
Her maidens; they, incontinent, throughout<span class="lnm">350</span><br />
All Troy convened the matrons, as she bade.<br />
Meantime into her wardrobe incense-fumed,<br />
Herself descended; there her treasures lay,<br />
Works of Sidonian women,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_6-21">[21]</a> whom her son<br />
The godlike Paris, when he cross'd the seas<span class="lnm">355</span><br />
With Jove-begotten Helen, brought to Troy.<br />
The most magnificent, and varied most<br />
With colors radiant, from the rest she chose<br />
For Pallas; vivid as a star it shone,<br />
And lowest lay of all. Then forth she went,<span class="lnm">360</span><br />
The Trojan matrons all following her steps.</p>
<p>But when the long procession reach'd the fane<br />
Of Pallas in the heights of Troy, to them<br />
The fair Theano ope'd the portals wide,<br />
Daughter of Cisseus, brave Antenor's spouse,<span class="lnm">365</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">153</span><a name="page_153" id="page_153"></a>
And by appointment public, at that time,<br />
Priestess of Pallas. All with lifted hands<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_6-22">[22]</a><br />
In presence of Minerva wept aloud.<br />
Beauteous Theano on the Goddess' lap<br />
Then spread the robe, and to the daughter fair<span class="lnm">370</span><br />
Of Jove omnipotent her suit address'd.</p>
<p>Goddess<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_6-23">[23]</a> of Goddesses, our city's shield,<br />
Adored Minerva, hear! oh! break the lance<br />
Of Diomede, and give himself to fall<br />
Prone in the dust before the Sc&aelig;an gate.<span class="lnm">375</span><br />
So will we offer to thee at thy shrine,<br />
This day twelve heifers of the year, untouch'd<br />
By yoke or goad, if thou wilt pity show<br />
To Troy, and save our children and our wives.</p>
<p>Such prayer the priestess offer'd, and such prayer<span class="lnm">380</span><br />
All present; whom Minerva heard averse.<br />
But Hector to the palace sped meantime<br />
Of Alexander, which himself had built,<br />
Aided by every architect of name<br />
Illustrious then in Troy. Chamber it had,<span class="lnm">385</span><br />
Wide hall, proud dome, and on the heights of Troy<br />
Near-neighboring Hector's house and Priam's stood.<br />
There enter'd Hector, Jove-beloved, a spear<br />
Its length eleven cubits in his hand,<br />
Its glittering head bound with a ring of gold.<span class="lnm">390</span><br />
He found within his chamber whom he sought,<br />
Polishing with exactest care his arms<br />
Resplendent, shield and hauberk fingering o'er<br />
With curious touch, and tampering with his bow.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_6-24">[24]</a><br />
Helen of Argos with her female train<span class="lnm">395</span><br />
Sat occupied, the while, to each in turn<br />
Some splendid task assigning. Hector fix'd<br />
His eyes on Paris, and him stern rebuked.</p>
<p>Thy sullen humors, Paris, are ill-timed.<br />
<span class="pgnm">154</span><a name="page_154" id="page_154"></a>
The people perish at our lofty walls;<span class="lnm">400</span><br />
The flames of war have compass'd Troy around<br />
And thou hast kindled them; who yet thyself<br />
That slackness show'st which in another seen<br />
Thou would'st resent to death. Haste, seek the field<br />
This moment, lest, the next, all Ilium blaze.<span class="lnm">405</span></p>
<p>To whom thus Paris, graceful as a God.<br />
Since, Hector, thou hast charged me with a fault,<br />
And not unjustly, I will answer make,<br />
And give thou special heed. That here I sit,<br />
The cause is sorrow, which I wish'd to soothe<span class="lnm">410</span><br />
In secret, not displeasure or revenge.<br />
I tell thee also, that even now my wife<br />
Was urgent with me in most soothing terms<br />
That I would forth to battle; and myself,<br />
Aware that victory oft changes sides,<span class="lnm">415</span><br />
That course prefer. Wait, therefore, thou awhile,<br />
'Till I shall dress me for the fight, or go<br />
Thou first, and I will overtake thee soon.</p>
<p>He ceased, to whom brave Hector answer none<br />
Return'd, when Helen him with lenient speech<span class="lnm">420</span><br />
Accosted mild.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_6-25">[25]</a> My brother! who in me<br />
Hast found a sister worthy of thy hate,<br />
Authoress of all calamity to Troy,<br />
Oh that the winds, the day when I was born,<br />
Had swept me out of sight, whirl'd me aloft<span class="lnm">425</span><br />
To some inhospitable mountain-top,<br />
Or plunged me in the deep; there I had sunk<br />
O'erwhelm'd, and all these ills had never been.<br />
But since the Gods would bring these ills to pass,<br />
I should, at least, some worthier mate have chosen,<span class="lnm">430</span><br />
One not insensible to public shame.<br />
But this, oh this, nor hath nor will acquire<br />
Hereafter, aught which like discretion shows<br />
Or reason, and shall find his just reward.<br />
But enter; take this seat; for who as thou<span class="lnm">435</span><br />
Labors, or who hath cause like thee to rue<br />
<span class="pgnm">155</span><a name="page_155" id="page_155"></a>
The crime, my brother, for which Heaven hath doom'd<br />
Both Paris and my most detested self<br />
To be the burthens of an endless song?</p>
<p>To whom the warlike Hector huge<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_6-26">[26]</a> replied.<span class="lnm">440</span><br />
Me bid not, Helen, to a seat, howe'er<br />
Thou wish my stay, for thou must not prevail.<br />
The Trojans miss me, and myself no less<br />
Am anxious to return. But urge in haste<br />
This loiterer forth; yea, let him urge himself<span class="lnm">445</span><br />
To overtake me ere I quit the town.<br />
For I must home in haste, that I may see<br />
My loved Andromache, my infant boy,<br />
And my domestics, ignorant if e'er<br />
I shall behold them more, or if my fate<span class="lnm">450</span><br />
Ordain me now to fall by Grecian hands.</p>
<p>So spake the dauntless hero, and withdrew.<br />
But reaching soon his own well-built abode<br />
He found not fair Andromache; she stood<br />
Lamenting Hector, with the nurse who bore<span class="lnm">455</span><br />
Her infant, on a turret's top sublime.<br />
He then, not finding his chaste spouse within,<br />
Thus from the portal, of her train inquired.</p>
<p>Tell me, ye maidens, whither went from home<br />
Andromache the fair?<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_6-27">[27]</a> Went she to see<span class="lnm">460</span><br />
Her female kindred of my father's house,<br />
Or to Minerva's temple, where convened<br />
The bright-hair'd matrons of the city seek<br />
To soothe the awful Goddess? Tell me true.</p>
<p>To whom his household's governess discreet.<span class="lnm">465</span><br />
Since, Hector, truth is thy demand, receive<br />
True answer. Neither went she forth to see<br />
<span class="pgnm">156</span><a name="page_156" id="page_156"></a>
Her female kindred of thy father's house,<br />
Nor to Minerva's temple, where convened<br />
The bright-haired matrons of the city seek<span class="lnm">470</span><br />
To soothe the awful Goddess; but she went<br />
Hence to the tower of Troy: for she had heard<br />
That the Achaians had prevail'd, and driven<br />
The Trojans to the walls; she, therefore, wild<br />
With grief, flew thither, and the nurse her steps<span class="lnm">475</span><br />
Attended, with thy infant in her arms.</p>
<p>So spake the prudent governess; whose words<br />
When Hector heard, issuing from his door<br />
He backward trod with hasty steps the streets<br />
Of lofty Troy, and having traversed all<span class="lnm">480</span><br />
The spacious city, when he now approach'd<br />
The Sc&aelig;an gate, whence he must seek the field,<br />
There, hasting home again his noble wife<br />
Met him, Andromache the rich-endow'd<br />
Fair daughter of E&euml;tion famed in arms.<span class="lnm">485</span><br />
E&euml;tion, who in Hypoplacian Thebes<br />
Umbrageous dwelt, Cilicia's mighty lord&mdash;<br />
His daughter valiant Hector had espoused.<br />
There she encounter'd him, and with herself<br />
The nurse came also, bearing in her arms<span class="lnm">490</span><br />
Hectorides, his infant darling boy,<br />
Beautiful as a star. Him Hector called<br />
Scamandrios, but Astyanax<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_6-28">[28]</a> all else<br />
In Ilium named him, for that Hector's arm<br />
Alone was the defence and strength of Troy.<span class="lnm">495</span><br />
The father, silent, eyed his babe, and smiled.<br />
Andromache, meantime, before him stood,<br />
With streaming cheeks, hung on his hand, and said.</p>
<p>Thy own great courage will cut short thy days,<br />
My noble Hector! neither pitiest thou<span class="lnm">500</span><br />
Thy helpless infant, or my hapless self,<br />
Whose widowhood is near; for thou wilt fall<br />
Ere long, assail'd by the whole host of Greece.<br />
Then let me to the tomb, my best retreat<br />
<span class="pgnm">157</span><a name="page_157" id="page_157"></a>
When thou art slain. For comfort none or joy<span class="lnm">505</span><br />
Can I expect, thy day of life extinct,<br />
But thenceforth, sorrow. Father I have none;<br />
No mother. When Cilicia's city, Thebes<br />
The populous, was by Achilles sack'd.<br />
He slew my father; yet his gorgeous arms<span class="lnm">510</span><br />
Stripp'd not through reverence of him, but consumed,<br />
Arm'd as it was, his body on the pile,<br />
And heap'd his tomb, which the Oreades,<br />
Jove's daughters, had with elms inclosed around.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_6-29">[29]</a><br />
My seven brothers, glory of our house,<span class="lnm">515</span><br />
All in one day descended to the shades;<br />
For brave Achilles,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_6-30">[30]</a> while they fed their herds<br />
And snowy flocks together, slew them all.<br />
My mother, Queen of the well-wooded realm<br />
Of Hypoplacian Thebes, her hither brought<span class="lnm">520</span><br />
Among his other spoils, he loosed again<br />
At an inestimable ransom-price,<br />
But by Diana pierced, she died at home.<br />
Yet Hector&mdash;oh my husband! I in thee<br />
Find parents, brothers, all that I have lost.<span class="lnm">525</span><br />
Come! have compassion on us. Go not hence,<br />
But guard this turret, lest of me thou make<br />
A widow, and an orphan of thy boy.<br />
The city walls are easiest of ascent<br />
At yonder fig-tree; station there thy powers;<span class="lnm">530</span><br />
For whether by a prophet warn'd, or taught<br />
By search and observation, in that part<br />
Each Ajax with Idomeneus of Crete,<br />
The sons of Atreus, and the valiant son<br />
<span class="pgnm">158</span><a name="page_158" id="page_158"></a>
Of Tydeus, have now thrice assail'd the town.<span class="lnm">535</span></p>
<p>To whom the leader of the host of Troy.</p>
<p>These cares, Andromache, which thee engage,<br />
All touch me also; but I dread to incur<br />
The scorn of male and female tongues in Troy,<br />
If, dastard-like, I should decline the fight.<span class="lnm">540</span><br />
Nor feel I such a wish. No. I have learn'd<br />
To be courageous ever, in the van<br />
Among the flower of Ilium to assert<br />
My glorious father's honor, and my own.<br />
For that the day shall come when sacred Troy,<span class="lnm">545</span><br />
When Priam, and the people of the old<br />
Spear-practised King shall perish, well I know.<br />
But for no Trojan sorrows yet to come<br />
So much I mourn, not e'en for Hecuba,<br />
Nor yet for Priam, nor for all the brave<span class="lnm">550</span><br />
Of my own brothers who shall kiss the dust,<br />
As for thyself, when some Achaian Chief<br />
Shall have convey'd thee weeping hence, thy sun<br />
Of peace and liberty for ever set.<br />
Then shalt thou toil in Argos at the loom<span class="lnm">555</span><br />
For a task-mistress, and constrain'd shalt draw<br />
From Hypere&iuml;a's fount,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_6-31">[31]</a> or from the fount<br />
Messe&iuml;s, water at her proud command.<br />
Some Grecian then, seeing thy tears, shall say&mdash;<br />
"This was the wife of Hector, who excell'd<span class="lnm">560</span><br />
All Troy in fight when Ilium was besieged."<br />
Such he shall speak thee, and thy heart, the while,<br />
Shall bleed afresh through want of such a friend<br />
To stand between captivity and thee.<br />
But may I rest beneath my hill of earth<span class="lnm">565</span><br />
Or ere that day arrive! I would not live<br />
To hear thy cries, and see thee torn away.</p>
<p>So saying, illustrious Hector stretch'd his arms<br />
Forth to his son, but with a scream, the child<br />
Fell back into the bosom of his nurse,<span class="lnm">570</span><br />
His father's aspect dreading, whose bright arms<br />
<span class="pgnm">159</span><a name="page_159" id="page_159"></a>
He had attentive mark'd and shaggy crest<br />
Playing tremendous o'er his helmet's height.<br />
His father and his gentle mother laugh'd,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_6-32">[32]</a><br />
And noble Hector lifting from his head<span class="lnm">575</span><br />
His dazzling helmet, placed it on the ground,<br />
Then kiss'd his boy and dandled him, and thus<br />
In earnest prayer the heavenly powers implored.</p>
<p>Hear all ye Gods! as ye have given to me,<br />
So also on my son excelling might<span class="lnm">580</span><br />
Bestow, with chief authority in Troy.<br />
And be his record this, in time to come,<br />
When he returns from battle. Lo! how far<br />
The son excels the sire! May every foe<br />
Fall under him, and he come laden home<span class="lnm">585</span><br />
With spoils blood-stain'd to his dear mother's joy.</p>
<p>He said, and gave his infant to the arms<br />
Of his Andromache, who him received<br />
Into her fragrant bosom, bitter tears<br />
With sweet smiles mingling; he with pity moved<span class="lnm">590</span><br />
That sight observed, soft touch'd her cheek, and said,</p>
<p>Mourn not, my loved Andromache, for me<br />
Too much; no man shall send me to the shades<br />
Of Tartarus, ere mine allotted hour,<br />
Nor lives he who can overpass the date<span class="lnm">595</span><br />
By heaven assign'd him, be he base or brave.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_6-33">[33]</a><br />
Go then, and occupy content at home<br />
The woman's province; ply the distaff, spin<br />
And weave, and task thy maidens. War belongs<br />
To man; to all men; and of all who first<span class="lnm">600</span><br />
Drew vital breath in Ilium, most to me.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_6-34">[34]</a></p>
<p><span class="pgnm">160</span><a name="page_160" id="page_160"></a>
He ceased, and from the ground his helmet raised<br />
Hair-crested; his Andromache, at once<br />
Obedient, to her home repair'd, but oft<br />
Turn'd as she went, and, turning, wept afresh.<span class="lnm">605</span><br />
No sooner at the palace she arrived<br />
Of havoc-spreading Hector, than among<br />
Her numerous maidens found within, she raised<br />
A general lamentation; with one voice,<br />
In his own house, his whole domestic train<span class="lnm">610</span><br />
Mourn'd Hector, yet alive; for none the hope<br />
Conceived of his escape from Grecian hands,<br />
Or to behold their living master more.</p>
<p>Nor Paris in his stately mansion long<br />
Delay'd, but, arm'd resplendent, traversed swift<span class="lnm">615</span><br />
The city, all alacrity and joy.<br />
As some stall'd horse high-fed, his stable-cord<br />
Snapt short, beats under foot the sounding plain,<br />
Accustomed in smooth-sliding streams to lave<br />
Exulting; high he bears his head, his mane<span class="lnm">620</span><br />
Undulates o'er his shoulders, pleased he eyes<br />
His glossy sides, and borne on pliant knees<br />
Shoots to the meadow where his fellows graze;<br />
So Paris, son of Priam, from the heights<br />
Of Pergamus into the streets of Troy,<span class="lnm">625</span><br />
All dazzling as the sun, descended, flush'd<br />
With martial pride, and bounding in his course.<br />
At once he came where noble Hector stood<br />
Now turning, after conference with his spouse,<br />
When godlike Alexander thus began.<span class="lnm">630</span></p>
<p>My hero brother, thou hast surely found<br />
My long delay most irksome. More dispatch<br />
Had pleased thee more, for such was thy command.</p>
<p>To whom the warlike Hector thus replied.<br />
No man, judicious, and in feat of arms<span class="lnm">635</span><br />
Intelligent, would pour contempt on thee<br />
(For thou art valiant) wert thou not remiss<br />
And wilful negligent; and when I hear<br />
The very men who labor in thy cause<br />
<span class="pgnm">161</span><a name="page_161" id="page_161"></a>
Reviling thee, I make thy shame my own.<span class="lnm">640</span><br />
But let us on. All such complaints shall cease<br />
Hereafter, and thy faults be touch'd no more,<br />
Let Jove but once afford us riddance clear<br />
Of these Achaians, and to quaff the cup<br />
Of liberty, before the living Gods.<span class="lnm">645</span></p>

<p>It may be observed, that Hector begins to resume his hope of success, and
his warlike spirit is roused again, as he approaches the field of action. The
depressing effect of his sad interview is wearing away from his mind, and
he is already prepared for the battle with Ajax, which awaits him.</p>

<p>The student who has once read this book, will read it again and again.
It contains much that is addressed to the deepest feelings of our common
nature, and, despite of the long interval of time which lies between our age
and the Homeric&mdash;despite the manifold changes of customs, habits, pursuits,
and the advances that have been made in civilization and art&mdash;despite of all
these, the universal spirit of humanity will recognize in these scenes much
of that true poetry which delights alike all ages, all nations, all men.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Felton</span>.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="noind">So saying, illustrious Hector through the gates<br />
To battle rush'd, with Paris at his side,<br />
And both were bent on deeds of high renown.<br />
As when the Gods vouchsafe propitious gales<br />
To longing mariners, who with smooth oars<span class="lnm">5</span><br />
Threshing the waves have all their strength consumed,<br />
So them the longing Trojans glad received.</p>
<p>At once each slew a Grecian. Paris slew<br />
Menesthius who in Arna dwelt, the son<br />
Of Areitho&uuml;s, club-bearing chief,<span class="lnm">10</span><br />
And of Philomedusa radiant-eyed.<br />
But Hector wounded with his glittering spear<br />
E&iuml;oneus; he pierced his neck beneath<br />
His brazen morion's verge, and dead he fell.<br />
Then Glaucus, leader of the Lycian host,<span class="lnm">15</span><br />
Son of Hippolochus, in furious fight<br />
Iphino&uuml;s son of Dexias assail'd,<br />
Mounting his rapid mares, and with his lance<br />
His shoulder pierced; unhorsed he fell and died.</p>
<p>Such slaughter of the Grecians in fierce fight<span class="lnm">20</span><br />
Minerva noting, from the Olympian hills<br />
Flew down to sacred Ilium; whose approach<br />
Marking from Pergamus, Apollo flew<br />
To meet her, ardent on the part of Troy.<br />
Beneath the beech they join'd, when first the King,<span class="lnm">25</span><br />
The son of Jove, Apollo thus began.</p>
<p><span class="pgnm">166</span><a name="page_166" id="page_166"></a>
Daughter of Jove supreme! why hast thou left<br />
Olympus, and with such impetuous speed?<br />
Comest thou to give the Dana&iuml; success<br />
Decisive? For I know that pity none<span class="lnm">30</span><br />
Thou feel'st for Trojans, perish as they may<br />
But if advice of mine can influence thee<br />
To that which shall be best, let us compose<br />
This day the furious fight which shall again<br />
Hereafter rage, till Ilium be destroy'd.<span class="lnm">35</span><br />
Since such is Juno's pleasure and thy own.</p>
<p>Him answer'd then Pallas c&aelig;rulean-eyed.<br />
Celestial archer! be it so. I came<br />
Myself so purposing into the field<br />
From the Olympian heights. But by what means<span class="lnm">40</span><br />
Wilt thou induce the warriors to a pause?</p>
<p>To whom the King, the son of Jove, replied.<br />
The courage of equestrian Hector bold<br />
Let us excite, that he may challenge forth<br />
To single conflict terrible some chief<span class="lnm">45</span><br />
Achaian. The Achaians brazen-mail'd<br />
Indignant, will supply a champion soon<br />
To combat with the noble Chief of Troy.</p>
<p>So spake Apollo, and his counsel pleased<br />
Minerva; which when Helenus the seer,<span class="lnm">50</span><br />
Priam's own son, in his prophetic soul<br />
Perceived, approaching Hector, thus he spake.</p>
<p>Jove's peer in wisdom, Hector, Priam's son!<br />
I am thy brother. Wilt thou list to me?<br />
Bid cease the battle. Bid both armies sit.<span class="lnm">55</span><br />
Call first, thyself, the mightiest of the Greeks<br />
To single conflict. I have heard the voice<br />
Of the Eternal Gods, and well-assured<br />
Foretell thee that thy death not now impends.</p>
<p>He spake, whom Hector heard with joy elate.<span class="lnm">60</span><br />
Before his van striding into the space<br />
Both hosts between, he with his spear transverse<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_7-1">[1]</a><br />
<span class="pgnm">167</span><a name="page_167" id="page_167"></a>
Press'd back the Trojans, and they sat. Down sat<br />
The well-greaved Grecians also at command<br />
Of Agamemnon; and in shape assumed<span class="lnm">65</span><br />
Of vultures, Pallas and Apollo perch'd<br />
High on the lofty beech sacred to Jove<br />
The father &AElig;gis-arm'd; delighted thence<br />
They view'd the peopled plain horrent around<br />
With shields and helms and glittering spears erect.<span class="lnm">70</span><br />
As when fresh-blowing Zephyrus the flood<br />
Sweeps first, the ocean blackens at the blast,<br />
Such seem'd the plain whereon the Achaians sat<br />
And Trojans, whom between thus Hector spake.</p>
<p>Ye Trojans and Achaians brazen-greaved,<span class="lnm">75</span><br />
Attend while I shall speak! Jove high-enthroned<br />
Hath not fulfill'd the truce, but evil plans<br />
Against both hosts, till either ye shall take<br />
Troy's lofty towers, or shall yourselves in flight<br />
Fall vanquish'd at your billow-cleaving barks.<span class="lnm">80</span><br />
With you is all the flower of Greece.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_7-2">[2]</a> Let him<br />
Whose heart shall move him to encounter sole<br />
Illustrious Hector, from among you all<br />
Stand forth, and Jove be witness to us both.<br />
If he, with his long-pointed lance, of life<span class="lnm">85</span><br />
Shall me bereave, my armor is his prize,<br />
Which he shall hence into your fleet convey;<br />
Not so my body; that he shall resign<br />
For burial to the men and wives of Troy.<br />
But if Apollo make the glory mine,<span class="lnm">90</span><br />
And he fall vanquish'd, him will I despoil,<br />
And hence conveying into sacred Troy<br />
His arms, will in the temple hang them high<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_7-3">[3]</a><br />
<span class="pgnm">168</span><a name="page_168" id="page_168"></a>
Of the bow-bender God, but I will send<br />
His body to the fleet, that him the Greeks<span class="lnm">95</span><br />
May grace with rights funereal. On the banks<br />
Of wide-spread Hellespont ye shall upraise<br />
His tomb, and as they cleave with oary barks<br />
The sable deep, posterity shall say&mdash;<br />
"It is a warrior's tomb; in ancient days<span class="lnm">100</span><br />
The Hero died; him warlike Hector slew."<br />
So men shall speak hereafter, and my fame<br />
Who slew him, and my praise, shall never die.</p>
<p>He ceased, and all sat mute. His challenge bold<br />
None dared accept, which yet they blush'd to shun,<span class="lnm">105</span><br />
Till Menelaus, at the last, arose<br />
Groaning profound, and thus reproach'd the Greeks.</p>
<p>Ah boasters! henceforth women&mdash;men no more&mdash;<br />
Eternal shame, shame infinite is ours,<br />
If none of all the Grecians dares contend<span class="lnm">110</span><br />
With Hector. Dastards&mdash;deaf to glory's call&mdash;<br />
Rot where ye sit! I will myself take arms<br />
Against him, for the gods alone dispose,<br />
At their own pleasure, the events of war.</p>
<p>He ended, and put on his radiant arms.<span class="lnm">115</span><br />
Then, Menelaus, manifest appear'd<br />
Thy death approaching by the dreadful hands<br />
Of Hector, mightier far in arms than thou,<br />
But that the Chiefs of the Achaians all<br />
Upstarting stay'd thee, and himself the King,<span class="lnm">120</span><br />
The son of Atreus, on thy better hand<br />
Seizing affectionate, thee thus address'd.</p>
<p>Thou ravest, my royal brother! and art seized<br />
With needless frenzy. But, however chafed,<br />
Restrain thy wrath, nor covet to contend<span class="lnm">125</span><br />
With Priameian Hector, whom in fight<br />
All dread, a warrior thy superior far.<br />
Not even Achilles, in the glorious field<br />
(Though stronger far than thou) this hero meets<br />
Undaunted. Go then, and thy seat resume<span class="lnm">130</span><br />
In thy own band; the Achaians shall for him,<br />
<span class="pgnm">169</span><a name="page_169" id="page_169"></a>
Doubtless, some fitter champion furnish forth.<br />
Brave though he be, and with the toils of war<br />
Insatiable, he shall be willing yet,<br />
Seated on his bent knees, to breathe a while,<span class="lnm">135</span><br />
Should he escape the arduous brunt severe.</p>
<p>So saying, the hero by his counsel wise<br />
His brother's purpose alter'd; he complied,<br />
And his glad servants eased him of his arms.<br />
Then Nestor thus the Argive host bespake.<span class="lnm">140</span></p>
<p>Great wo, ye Gods! hath on Achaia fallen.<br />
Now may the warlike Pelaus, hoary Chief,<br />
Who both with eloquence and wisdom rules<br />
The Myrmidons, our foul disgrace deplore.<br />
With him discoursing, erst, of ancient times,<span class="lnm">145</span><br />
When all your pedigrees I traced, I made<br />
His heart bound in him at the proud report.<br />
But now, when he shall learn how here we sat<br />
Cowering at the foot of Hector, he shall oft<br />
His hands uplift to the immortal Gods,<span class="lnm">150</span><br />
Praying a swift release into the shades.<br />
Jove! Pallas! Ph&oelig;bus! Oh that I were young<br />
As when the Pylians in fierce fight engaged<br />
The Arcadians spear-expert, beside the stream<br />
Of rapid Celadon! Beneath the walls<span class="lnm">155</span><br />
We fought of Pheia, where the Jardan rolls.<br />
There Ereuthalion, Chief of godlike form,<br />
Stood forth before his van, and with loud voice<br />
Defied the Pylians. Arm'd he was in steel<br />
By royal Are&iuml;thous whilom worn;<span class="lnm">160</span><br />
Brave Are&iuml;thous, Corynetes<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_7-4">[4]</a> named<br />
By every tongue; for that in bow and spear<br />
Nought trusted he, but with an iron mace<br />
The close-embattled phalanx shatter'd wide.<br />
Him by address, not by superior force,<span class="lnm">165</span><br />
Lycurgus vanquish'd, in a narrow pass,<br />
Where him his iron whirl-bat<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_7-5">[5]</a> nought avail'd.<br />
Lycurgus stealing on him, with his lance<br />
<span class="pgnm">170</span><a name="page_170" id="page_170"></a>
Transpierced and fix'd him to the soil supine.<br />
Him of his arms, bright gift of brazen Mars,<span class="lnm">170</span><br />
He stripp'd, which after, in the embattled field<br />
Lycurgus wore himself, but, growing old,<br />
Surrender'd them to Ereuthalion's use<br />
His armor-bearer, high in his esteem,<br />
And Ereuthalion wore them on the day<span class="lnm">175</span><br />
When he defied our best. All hung their heads<br />
And trembled; none dared meet him; till at last<br />
With inborn courage warm'd, and nought dismayed,<br />
Though youngest of them all, I undertook<br />
That contest, and, by Pallas' aid, prevail'd.<span class="lnm">180</span><br />
I slew the man in height and bulk all men<br />
Surpassing, and much soil he cover'd slain.<br />
Oh for the vigor of those better days!<br />
Then should not Hector want a champion long,<br />
Whose call to combat, ye, although the prime<span class="lnm">185</span><br />
And pride of all our land, seem slow to hear.</p>
<p>He spake reproachful, when at once arose<br />
Nine heroes. Agamemnon, King of men,<br />
Foremost arose; then Tydeus' mighty son,<br />
With either Ajax in fierce prowess clad;<span class="lnm">190</span><br />
The Cretan next, Idomeneus, with whom<br />
Uprose Meriones his friend approved,<br />
Terrible as the man-destroyer Mars.<br />
Ev&aelig;mon's noble offspring next appear'd<br />
Eurypylus; Andr&aelig;mon's son the next<span class="lnm">195</span><br />
Thoas; and last, Ulysses, glorious Chief.<br />
All these stood ready to engage in arms<br />
With warlike Hector, when the ancient King,<br />
Gerenian Nestor, thus his speech resumed.</p>
<p>Now cast the lot for all. Who wins the chance<span class="lnm">200</span><br />
Shall yield Achaia service, and himself<br />
Serve also, if successful he escape<br />
This brunt of hostile hardiment severe.</p>
<p>So Nestor. They, inscribing each his lot,<br />
Into the helmet cast it of the son<span class="lnm">205</span><br />
Of Atreus, Agamemnon. Then the host<br />
<span class="pgnm">171</span><a name="page_171" id="page_171"></a>
Pray'd all, their hands uplifting, and with eyes<br />
To the wide heavens directed, many said<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_7-6">[6]</a>&mdash;</p>
<p>Eternal sire! choose Ajax, or the son<br />
Of Tydeus, or the King himself<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_7-7">[7]</a> who sways<span class="lnm">210</span><br />
The sceptre in Mycen&aelig; wealth-renown'd!</p>
<p>Such prayer the people made; then Nestor shook<br />
The helmet, and forth leaped, whose most they wished,<br />
The lot of Ajax. Throughout all the host<br />
To every chief and potentate of Greece,<span class="lnm">215</span><br />
From right to left the herald bore the lot<br />
By all disown'd; but when at length he reach'd<br />
The inscriber of the lot, who cast it in,<br />
Illustrious Ajax, in his open palm<br />
The herald placed it, standing at his side.<span class="lnm">220</span><br />
He, conscious, with heroic joy the lot<br />
Cast at his foot, and thus exclaim'd aloud.</p>
<p>My friends! the lot is mine,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_7-8">[8]</a> and my own heart<br />
Rejoices also; for I nothing doubt<br />
That noble Hector shall be foil'd by me.<span class="lnm">225</span><br />
But while I put mine armor on, pray all<br />
In silence to the King Saturnian Jove,<br />
Lest, while ye pray, the Trojans overhear.<br />
Or pray aloud, for whom have we to dread?<br />
No man shall my firm standing by his strength<span class="lnm">230</span><br />
Unsettle, or for ignorance of mine<br />
Me vanquish, who, I hope, brought forth and train'd<br />
In Salamis, have, now, not much to learn.</p>
<p>He ended. They with heaven-directed eyes<br />
The King in prayer address'd, Saturnian Jove.<span class="lnm">235</span></p>
<p>Jove! glorious father! who from Ida's height<br />
Controlest all below, let Ajax prove<br />
Victorious; make the honor all his own!<br />
Or, if not less than Ajax, Hector share<br />
<span class="pgnm">172</span><a name="page_172" id="page_172"></a>
Thy love and thy regard, divide the prize<span class="lnm">240</span><br />
Of glory, and let each achieve renown!</p>
<p>Then Ajax put his radiant armor on,<br />
And, arm'd complete, rush'd forward. As huge Mars<br />
To battle moves the sons of men between<br />
Whom Jove with heart-devouring thirst inspires<span class="lnm">245</span><br />
Of war, so moved huge Ajax to the fight,<br />
Tower of the Greeks, dilating with a smile<br />
His martial features terrible; on feet,<br />
Firm-planted, to the combat he advanced<br />
Stride after stride, and shook his quivering spear.<span class="lnm">250</span><br />
Him viewing, Argos' universal host<br />
Exulted, while a panic loosed the knees<br />
Of every Trojan; even Hector's heart<br />
Beat double, but escape for him remain'd<br />
None now, or to retreat into his ranks<span class="lnm">255</span><br />
Again, from whom himself had challenged forth.<br />
Ajax advancing like a tower his shield<br />
Sevenfold, approach'd. It was the labor'd work<br />
Of Tychius, armorer of matchless skill,<br />
Who dwelt in Hyla; coated with the hides<span class="lnm">260</span><br />
Of seven high-pamper'd bulls that shield he framed<br />
For Ajax, and the disk plated with brass.<br />
Advancing it before his breast, the son<br />
Of Telamon approach'd the Trojan Chief,<br />
And face to face, him threatening, thus began.<span class="lnm">265</span></p>
<p>Now, Hector, prove, by me alone opposed,<br />
What Chiefs the Dana&iuml; can furnish forth<br />
In absence of the lion-hearted prince<br />
Achilles, breaker of the ranks of war.<br />
He, in his billow-cleaving barks incensed<span class="lnm">270</span><br />
Against our leader Agamemnon, lies;<br />
But warriors of my measure, who may serve<br />
To cope with thee, we want not; numerous such<br />
Are found amongst us. But begin the fight.</p>
<p>To whom majestic Hector fierce in arms.<span class="lnm">275</span><br />
Ajax! heroic leader of the Greeks!<br />
Offspring of Telamon! essay not me<br />
<span class="pgnm">173</span><a name="page_173" id="page_173"></a>
With words to terrify, as I were boy.<br />
Or girl unskill'd in war;<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_7-9">[9]</a> I am a man<br />
Well exercised in battle, who have shed<span class="lnm">280</span><br />
The blood of many a warrior, and have learn'd,<br />
From hand to hand shifting my shield, to fight<br />
Unwearied; I can make a sport of war,<br />
In standing fight adjusting all my steps<br />
To martial measures sweet, or vaulting light<span class="lnm">285</span><br />
Into my chariot, thence can urge the foe.<br />
Yet in contention with a Chief like thee<br />
I will employ no stratagem, or seek<br />
To smite thee privily, but with a stroke<br />
(If I may reach thee) visible to all.<span class="lnm">290</span></p>
<p>So saying, he shook, then hurl'd his massy spear<br />
At Ajax, and his broad shield sevenfold<br />
On its eighth surface of resplendent brass<br />
Smote full; six hides the unblunted weapon pierced,<br />
But in the seventh stood rooted. Ajax, next,<span class="lnm">295</span><br />
Heroic Chief, hurl'd his long shadow'd spear<br />
And struck the oval shield of Priam's son.<br />
Through his bright disk the weapon tempest-driven<br />
Glided, and in his hauberk-rings infixt<br />
At his soft flank, ripp'd wide his vest within.<span class="lnm">300</span><br />
Inclined oblique he 'scaped the dreadful doom<br />
Then each from other's shield his massy spear<br />
Recovering quick, like lions hunger-pinch'd<br />
Or wild boars irresistible in force,<br />
They fell to close encounter. Priam's son<span class="lnm">305</span><br />
The shield of Ajax at its centre smote,<br />
But fail'd to pierce it, for he bent his point.<br />
Sprang Ajax then, and meeting full the targe<br />
Of Hector, shock'd him; through it and beyond<br />
He urged the weapon with its sliding edge<span class="lnm">310</span><br />
Athwart his neck, and blood was seen to start.<br />
But still, for no such cause, from battle ceased<br />
Crest-tossing Hector, but retiring, seized<br />
<span class="pgnm">174</span><a name="page_174" id="page_174"></a>
A huge stone angled sharp and black with age<br />
That on the champain lay. The bull-hide guard<span class="lnm">315</span><br />
Sevenfold of Ajax with that stone he smote<br />
Full on its centre; sang the circling brass.<br />
Then Ajax far a heavier stone upheaved;<br />
He whirled it, and with might immeasurable<br />
Dismiss'd the mass, which with a mill-stone weight<span class="lnm">320</span><br />
Sank through the shield of Hector, and his knees<br />
Disabled; with his shield supine he fell,<br />
But by Apollo raised, stood soon again.<br />
And now, with swords they had each other hewn,<br />
Had not the messengers of Gods and men<span class="lnm">325</span><br />
The heralds wise, Id&aelig;us on the part<br />
Of Ilium, and Talthybius for the Greeks,<br />
Advancing interposed. His sceptre each<br />
Between them held, and thus Id&aelig;us spake.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_7-10">[10]</a></p>
<p>My children, cease! prolong not still the fight.<span class="lnm">330</span><br />
Ye both are dear to cloud-assembler Jove,<br />
Both valiant, and all know it. But the Night<br />
Hath fallen, and Night's command must be obeyed.</p>
<p>To him the son of Telamon replied.<br />
Id&aelig;us! bid thy master speak as thou.<span class="lnm">335</span><br />
He is the challenger. If such his choice,<br />
Mine differs not; I wait but to comply.</p>
<p>Him answer'd then heroic Hector huge.<br />
Since, Ajax, the immortal powers on thee<br />
Have bulk pre-eminent and strength bestow'd,<span class="lnm">340</span><br />
With such address in battle, that the host<br />
Of Greece hath not thine equal at the spear,<br />
Now let the combat cease. We shall not want<br />
More fair occasion; on some future day<br />
We will not part till all-disposing heaven<span class="lnm">345</span><br />
Shall give thee victory, or shall make her mine.<br />
<span class="pgnm">175</span><a name="page_175" id="page_175"></a>
But Night hath fallen, and Night must be obey'd,<br />
That them may'st gratify with thy return<br />
The Achaians, and especially thy friends<br />
And thy own countrymen. I go, no less<span class="lnm">350</span><br />
To exhilarate in Priam's royal town<br />
Men and robed matrons, who shall seek the Gods<br />
For me, with pious ceremonial due.<br />
But come. We will exchange, or ere we part,<br />
Some princely gift, that Greece and Troy may say<span class="lnm">355</span><br />
Hereafter, with soul-wasting rage they fought,<br />
But parted with the gentleness of friends.</p>
<p>So saying, he with his sheath and belt a sword<br />
Presented bright-emboss'd, and a bright belt<br />
Purpureal<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_7-11">[11]</a> took from Ajax in return.<span class="lnm">360</span><br />
Thus separated, one the Grecians sought,<br />
And one the Trojans; they when him they saw<br />
From the unconquer'd hands return'd alive<br />
Of Ajax, with delight their Chief received,<br />
And to the city led him, double joy<span class="lnm">365</span><br />
Conceiving all at his unhoped escape.<br />
On the other side, the Grecians brazen-mail'd<br />
To noble Agamemnon introduced<br />
Exulting Ajax, and the King of men<br />
In honor of the conqueror slew an ox<span class="lnm">370</span><br />
Of the fifth year to Jove omnipotent.<br />
Him flaying first, they carved him next and spread<br />
The whole abroad, then, scoring deep the flesh,<br />
They pierced it with the spits, and from the spits<br />
(Once roasted well) withdrew it all again.<span class="lnm">375</span><br />
Their labor thus accomplish'd, and the board<br />
Furnish'd with plenteous cheer, they feasted all<br />
Till all were satisfied; nor Ajax miss'd<br />
The conqueror's meed, to whom the hero-king<br />
Wide-ruling Agamemnon, gave the chine<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_7-12">[12]</a><span class="lnm">380</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">176</span><a name="page_176" id="page_176"></a>
Perpetual,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_7-13">[13]</a> his distinguish'd portion due.<br />
The calls of hunger and of thirst at length<br />
Both well sufficed, thus, foremost of them all<br />
The ancient Nestor, whose advice had oft<br />
Proved salutary, prudent thus began.<span class="lnm">385</span></p>
<p>Chiefs of Achaia, and thou, chief of all,<br />
Great Agamemnon! Many of our host<br />
Lie slain, whose blood sprinkles, in battle shed,<br />
The banks of smooth Scamander, and their souls<br />
Have journey'd down into the realms of death.<span class="lnm">390</span><br />
To-morrow, therefore, let the battle pause<br />
As need requires, and at the peep of day<br />
With mules and oxen, wheel ye from all parts<br />
The dead, that we may burn them near the fleet.<br />
So, home to Greece returning, will we give<span class="lnm">395</span><br />
The fathers' ashes to the children's care.<br />
Accumulating next, the pile around,<br />
One common tomb for all, with brisk dispatch<br />
We will upbuild for more secure defence<br />
Of us and of our fleet, strong towers and tall<span class="lnm">400</span><br />
Adjoining to the tomb, and every tower<br />
Shall have its ponderous gate, commodious pass<br />
Affording to the mounted charioteer.<br />
And last, without those towers and at their foot,<br />
Dig we a trench, which compassing around<span class="lnm">405</span><br />
Our camp, both steeds and warriors shall exclude,<br />
And all fierce inroad of the haughty foe.</p>
<p>So counsell'd he, whom every Chief approved.<br />
<span class="pgnm">177</span><a name="page_177" id="page_177"></a>
In Troy meantime, at Priam's gate beside<br />
The lofty citadel, debate began<span class="lnm">410</span><br />
The assembled senators between, confused,<br />
Clamorous, and with furious heat pursued,<br />
When them Antenor, prudent, thus bespake.</p>
<p>Ye Trojans, Dardans, and allies of Troy,<br />
My counsel hear! Delay not. Instant yield<span class="lnm">415</span><br />
To the Atrid&aelig;, hence to be convey'd,<br />
Helen of Greece with all that is her own.<br />
For charged with violated oaths we fight,<br />
And hope I none conceive that aught by us<br />
Design'd shall prosper, unless so be done.<span class="lnm">420</span></p>
<p>He spake and sat; when from his seat arose<br />
Paris, fair Helen's noble paramour,<br />
Who thus with speech impassion'd quick replied.</p>
<p>Antenor! me thy counsel hath not pleased;<br />
Thou could'st have framed far better; but if this<span class="lnm">425</span><br />
Be thy deliberate judgment, then the Gods<br />
Make thy deliberate judgment nothing worth.<br />
But I will speak myself. Ye Chiefs of Troy,<br />
I tell you plain. I will not yield my spouse.<br />
But all her treasures to our house convey'd<span class="lnm">430</span><br />
From Argos, those will I resign, and add<br />
Still other compensation from my own.</p>
<p>Thus Paris said and sat; when like the Gods<br />
Themselves in wisdom, from his seat uprose<br />
Dardanian Priam, who them thus address'd.<span class="lnm">435</span></p>
<p>Trojans, Dardanians, and allies of Troy!<br />
I shall declare my sentence; hear ye me.<br />
Now let the legions, as at other times,<br />
Take due refreshment; let the watch be set,<br />
And keep ye vigilant guard. At early dawn<span class="lnm">440</span><br />
We will dispatch Id&aelig;us to the fleet,<br />
Who shall inform the Atrid&aelig; of this last<br />
Resolve of Paris, author of the war.<br />
Discreet Id&aelig;us also shall propose<br />
A respite (if the Atrid&aelig; so incline)<span class="lnm">445</span><br />
From war's dread clamor, while we burn the dead.<br />
<span class="pgnm">178</span><a name="page_178" id="page_178"></a>
Then will we clash again, till heaven at length<br />
Shall part us, and the doubtful strife decide.</p>
<p>He ceased, whose voice the assembly pleased, obey'd.<br />
Then, troop by troop, the army took repast,<span class="lnm">450</span><br />
And at the dawn Id&aelig;us sought the fleet.<br />
He found the Dana&iuml;, servants of Mars,<br />
Beside the stern of Agamemnon's ship<br />
Consulting; and amid the assembled Chiefs<br />
Arrived, with utterance clear them thus address'd.<span class="lnm">455</span></p>
<p>Ye sons of Atreus, and ye Chiefs, the flower<br />
Of all Achaia! Priam and the Chiefs<br />
Of Ilium, bade me to your ear impart<br />
(If chance such embassy might please your ear)<br />
The mind of Paris, author of the war.<span class="lnm">460</span><br />
The treasures which on board his ships he brought<br />
From Argos home (oh, had he perish'd first!)<br />
He yields them with addition from his own.<br />
Not so the consort of the glorious prince<br />
Brave Menelaus; her (although in Troy<span class="lnm">465</span><br />
All counsel otherwise) he still detains.<br />
Thus too I have in charge. Are ye inclined<br />
That the dread sounding clamors of the field<br />
Be caused to cease till we shall burn the dead?<br />
Then will we clash again, 'till heaven at length<span class="lnm">470</span><br />
Shall part us, and the doubtful strife decide.</p>
<p>So spake Id&aelig;us, and all silent sat;<br />
Till at the last brave Diomede replied.</p>
<p>No. We will none of Paris' treasures now,<br />
Nor even Helen's self. A child may see<span class="lnm">475</span><br />
Destruction winging swift her course to Troy.</p>
<p>He said. The admiring Greeks with loud applause<br />
All praised the speech of warlike Diomede,<br />
And answer thus the King of men return'd.</p>
<p>Id&aelig;us! thou hast witness'd the resolve<span class="lnm">480</span><br />
Of the Achaian Chiefs, whose choice is mine.<br />
But for the slain, I shall not envy them<br />
A funeral pile; the spirit fled, delay<br />
Suits not. Last rites can not too soon be paid.<br />
<span class="pgnm">179</span><a name="page_179" id="page_179"></a>
Burn them. And let high-thundering Jove attest<span class="lnm">485</span><br />
Himself mine oath, that war shall cease the while.</p>
<p>So saying, he to all the Gods upraised<br />
His sceptre, and Id&aelig;us homeward sped<br />
To sacred Ilium. The Dardanians there<br />
And Trojans, all assembled, his return<span class="lnm">490</span><br />
Expected anxious. He amid them told<br />
Distinct his errand, when, at once dissolved,<br />
The whole assembly rose, these to collect<br />
The scatter'd bodies, those to gather wood;<br />
While on the other side, the Greeks arose<span class="lnm">495</span><br />
As sudden, and all issuing from the fleet<br />
Sought fuel, some, and some, the scatter'd dead.</p>
<p>Now from the gently-swelling flood profound<br />
The sun arising, with his earliest rays<br />
In his ascent to heaven smote on the fields.<span class="lnm">500</span><br />
When Greeks and Trojans met. Scarce could the slain<br />
Be clear distinguish'd, but they cleansed from each<br />
His clotted gore with water, and warm tears<br />
Distilling copious, heaved them to the wains.<br />
But wailing none was heard, for such command<span class="lnm">505</span><br />
Had Priam issued; therefore heaping high<br />
The bodies, silent and with sorrowing hearts<br />
They burn'd them, and to sacred Troy return'd.<br />
The Grecians also, on the funeral pile<br />
The bodies heaping sad, burn'd them with fire<span class="lnm">510</span><br />
Together, and return'd into the fleet.<br />
Then, ere the peep of dawn, and while the veil<br />
Of night, though thinner, still o'erhung the earth,<br />
Achaians, chosen from the rest, the pile<br />
Encompass'd. With a tomb (one tomb for all)<span class="lnm">515</span><br />
They crown'd the spot adust, and to the tomb<br />
(For safety of their fleet and of themselves)<br />
Strong fortress added of high wall and tower,<br />
With solid gates affording egress thence<br />
Commodious to the mounted charioteer;<span class="lnm">520</span><br />
Deep foss and broad they also dug without,<br />
And planted it with piles. So toil'd the Greeks.</p>
<p><span class="pgnm">180</span><a name="page_180" id="page_180"></a>
The Gods, that mighty labor, from beside<br />
The Thunderer's throne with admiration view'd,<br />
When Neptune, shaker of the shores, began.<span class="lnm">525</span></p>
<p>Eternal father! is there on the face<br />
Of all the boundless earth one mortal man<br />
Who will, in times to come, consult with heaven?<br />
See'st thou yon height of wall, and yon deep trench<br />
With which the Grecians have their fleet inclosed,<span class="lnm">530</span><br />
And, careless of our blessing, hecatomb<br />
Or invocation have presented none?<br />
Far as the day-spring shoots herself abroad,<br />
So far the glory of this work shall spread,<br />
While Ph&oelig;bus and myself, who, toiling hard,<span class="lnm">535</span><br />
Built walls for king Laomedon, shall see<br />
Forgotten all the labor of our hands.</p>
<p>To whom, indignant, thus high-thundering Jove.<br />
Oh thou, who shakest the solid earth at will,<br />
What hast thou spoken? An inferior power,<span class="lnm">540</span><br />
A god of less sufficiency than thou,<br />
Might be allowed some fear from such a cause.<br />
Fear not. Where'er the morning shoots her beams,<br />
Thy glory shall be known; and when the Greeks<br />
Shall seek their country through the waves again,<span class="lnm">545</span><br />
Then break this bulwark down, submerge it whole,<br />
And spreading deep with sand the spacious shore<br />
As at the first, leave not a trace behind.</p>
<p>Such conference held the Gods; and now the sun<br />
Went down, and, that great work perform'd, the Greeks<span class="lnm">550</span><br />
From tent to tent slaughter'd the fatted ox<br />
And ate their evening cheer. Meantime arrived<br />
Large fleet with Lemnian wine; Euneus, son<br />
Of Jason and Hypsipile, that fleet<br />
From Lemnos freighted, and had stow'd on board<span class="lnm">555</span><br />
A thousand measures from the rest apart<br />
For the Atrid&aelig;; but the host at large<br />
By traffic were supplied; some barter'd brass,<br />
Others bright steel; some purchased wine with hides,<br />
These with their cattle, with their captives those,<span class="lnm">560</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">181</span><a name="page_181" id="page_181"></a>
And the whole host prepared a glad regale.<br />
All night the Grecians feasted, and the host<br />
Of Ilium, and all night deep-planning Jove<br />
Portended dire calamities to both,<br />
Thundering tremendous!&mdash;Pale was every cheek;<span class="lnm">565</span><br />
Each pour'd his goblet on the ground, nor dared<br />
The hardiest drink, 'till he had first perform'd<br />
Libation meet to the Saturnian King<br />
Omnipotent; then, all retiring, sought<br />
Their couches, and partook the gift of sleep.<span class="lnm">570</span></p>

<h3 class="chap">ARGUMENT OF THE EIGHTH BOOK.</h3>

<p class="outd">Jove calls a council, in which he forbids all interference of the Gods between
the Greeks and Trojans. He repairs to Ida, where, having consulted
the scales of destiny, he directs his lightning against the Grecians.
Nestor is endangered by the death of one of his horses. Diomede delivers
him. In the chariot of Diomede they both hasten to engage Hector,
whose charioteer is slain by Diomede. Jupiter again interposes by his
thunders, and the whole Grecian host, discomfited, is obliged to seek
refuge within the rampart. Diomede, with others, at sight of a favorable
omen sent from Jove in answer to Agamemnon's prayer, sallies. Teucer
performs great exploits, but is disabled by Hector. Juno and Pallas set
forth from Olympus in aid of the Grecians, but are stopped by Jupiter,
who reascends from Ida, and in heaven foretells the distresses which await
the Grecians.</p>

<p class="outd">Hector takes measures for the security of Troy during the night, and
prepares his host for an assault to be made on the Grecian camp in the
morning.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="noind">The saffron-mantled morning<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_8-1">[1]</a> now was spread<br />
O'er all the nations, when the Thunderer Jove<br />
On the deep-fork'd Olympian topmost height<br />
Convened the Gods in council, amid whom<br />
He spake himself; they all attentive heard.<span class="lnm">5</span></p>
<p>Gods! Goddesses! Inhabitants of heaven!<br />
Attend; I make my secret purpose known.<br />
Let neither God nor Goddess interpose<br />
My counsel to rescind, but with one heart<br />
Approve it, that it reach, at once, its end.<span class="lnm">10</span><br />
Whom I shall mark soever from the rest<br />
Withdrawn, that he may Greeks or Trojans aid,<br />
Disgrace shall find him; shamefully chastised<br />
He shall return to the Olympian heights,<br />
Or I will hurl him deep into the gulfs<span class="lnm">15</span><br />
Of gloomy Tartarus, where Hell shuts fast<br />
Her iron gates, and spreads her brazen floor,<br />
As far below the shades, as earth from heaven.<br />
There shall he learn how far I pass in might<br />
All others; which if ye incline to doubt,<span class="lnm">20</span><br />
Now prove me. Let ye down the golden chain<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_8-2">[2]</a><br />
From heaven, and at its nether links pull all,<br />
<span class="pgnm">186</span><a name="page_186" id="page_186"></a>
Both Goddesses and Gods. But me your King,<br />
Supreme in wisdom, ye shall never draw<br />
To earth from heaven, toil adverse as ye may.<span class="lnm">25</span><br />
Yet I, when once I shall be pleased to pull,<br />
The earth itself, itself the sea, and you<br />
Will lift with ease together, and will wind<br />
The chain around the spiry summit sharp<br />
Of the Olympian, that all things upheaved<span class="lnm">30</span><br />
Shall hang in the mid heaven. So far do I,<br />
Compared with all who live, transcend them all.</p>
<p>He ended, and the Gods long time amazed<br />
Sat silent, for with awful tone he spake:<br />
But at the last Pallas blue-eyed began.<span class="lnm">35</span></p>
<p>Father! Saturnian Jove! of Kings supreme!<br />
We know thy force resistless; but our hearts<br />
Feel not the less, when we behold the Greeks<br />
Exhausting all the sorrows of their lot.<br />
If thou command, we, doubtless, will abstain<span class="lnm">40</span><br />
From battle, yet such counsel to the Greeks<br />
Suggesting still, as may in part effect<br />
Their safety, lest thy wrath consume them all.</p>
<p>To whom with smiles answer'd cloud-gatherer Jove.<br />
Fear not, my child! stern as mine accent was,<span class="lnm">45</span><br />
I forced a frown&mdash;no more. For in mine heart<br />
Nought feel I but benevolence to thee.</p>
<p>He said, and to his chariot join'd his steeds<br />
Swift, brazen-hoof'd, and mailed with wavy gold;<br />
He put on golden raiment, his bright scourge<span class="lnm">50</span><br />
Of gold receiving rose into his seat,<br />
And lash'd his steeds; they not unwilling flew<br />
Midway the earth between and starry heaven.<br />
To spring-fed Ida, mother of wild beasts,<br />
He came, where stands in Gargarus<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_8-3">[3]</a> his shrine<span class="lnm">55</span><br />
Breathing fresh incense! there the Sire of all<br />
<span class="pgnm">187</span><a name="page_187" id="page_187"></a>
Arriving, loosed his coursers, and around<br />
Involving them in gather'd clouds opaque,<br />
Sat on the mountain's head, in his own might<br />
Exulting, with the towers of Ilium all<span class="lnm">60</span><br />
Beneath his eye, and the whole fleet of Greece.</p>
<p>In all their tents, meantime, Achaia's sons<br />
Took short refreshment, and for fight prepared.<br />
On the other side, though fewer, yet constrain'd<br />
By strong necessity, throughout all Troy,<span class="lnm">65</span><br />
In the defence of children and wives<br />
Ardent, the Trojans panted for the field.<br />
Wide flew the city gates: forth rush'd to war<br />
Horsemen and foot, and tumult wild arose.<br />
They met, they clash'd; loud was the din of spears<span class="lnm">70</span><br />
And bucklers on their bosoms brazen-mail'd<br />
Encountering, shields in opposition from<br />
Met bossy shields, and tumult wild arose.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_8-4">[4]</a></p>
<p>There many a shout and many a dying groan<br />
Were heard, the slayer and the maim'd aloud<span class="lnm">75</span><br />
Clamoring, and the earth was drench'd with blood.<br />
'Till sacred morn<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_8-5">[5]</a> had brighten'd into noon,<br />
The vollied weapons on both sides their task<br />
Perform'd effectual, and the people fell.<br />
But when the sun had climb'd the middle skies,<span class="lnm">80</span><br />
The Sire of all then took his golden scales;<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_8-6">[6]</a><br />
Doom against doom he weigh'd, the eternal fates<br />
In counterpoise, of Trojans and of Greeks.<br />
He rais'd the beam; low sank the heavier lot<br />
Of the Achaians; the Achaian doom<span class="lnm">85</span><br />
Subsided, and the Trojan struck the skies.</p>
<p>Then roar'd the thunders from the summit hurl'd<br />
of Ida, and his vivid lightnings flew<br />
Into Achaia's host. They at the sight<br />
<span class="pgnm">188</span><a name="page_188" id="page_188"></a>
Astonish'd stood; fear whiten'd every cheek.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_8-7">[7]</a><span class="lnm">90</span><br />
Idomeneus dared not himself abide<br />
That shock, nor Agamemnon stood, nor stood<br />
The heroes Ajax, ministers of Mars.<br />
Gerenian Nestor, guardian of the Greeks,<br />
Alone fled not, nor he by choice remain'd,<span class="lnm">95</span><br />
But by his steed retarded, which the mate<br />
Of beauteous Helen, Paris, with a shaft<br />
Had stricken where the forelock grows, a part<br />
Of all most mortal. Tortured by the wound<br />
Erect he rose, the arrow in his brain,<span class="lnm">100</span><br />
And writhing furious, scared his fellow-steeds.<br />
Meantime, while, strenuous, with his falchion's edge<br />
The hoary warrior stood slashing the reins,<br />
Through multitudes of fierce pursuers borne<br />
On rapid wheels, the dauntless charioteer<span class="lnm">105</span><br />
Approach'd him, Hector. Then, past hope, had died<br />
The ancient King, but Diomede discern'd<br />
His peril imminent, and with a voice<br />
Like thunder, called Ulysses to his aid.</p>
<p>Laertes' noble son, for wiles renown'd!<span class="lnm">110</span><br />
Art thou too fugitive, and turn'st thy back<br />
Like the base multitude? Ah! fear a lance<br />
Implanted ignominious in thy spine.<br />
Stop&mdash;Nestor dies. Fell Hector is at hand.</p>
<p>So shouted Diomede, whose summons loud,<span class="lnm">115</span><br />
Ulysses yet heard not, but, passing, flew<br />
With headlong haste to the Achaian fleet.<br />
Then, Diomede, unaided as he was,<br />
Rush'd ardent to the vanward, and before<br />
The steeds of the Neleian sovereign old<span class="lnm">120</span><br />
Standing, in accents wing'd, him thus address'd.</p>
<p>Old Chief! these youthful warriors are too brisk<br />
<span class="pgnm">189</span><a name="page_189" id="page_189"></a>
For thee, press'd also by encroaching age,<br />
Thy servant too is feeble, and thy steeds<br />
Are tardy. Mount my chariot. Thou shalt see<span class="lnm">125</span><br />
With what rapidity the steeds of Troy,<br />
Pursuing or retreating, scour the field.<br />
I took them from that terror of his foes,<br />
&AElig;neas. Thine to our attendants leave,<br />
While these against the warlike powers of Troy<span class="lnm">130</span><br />
We push direct; that Hector's self may know<br />
If my spear rage not furious as his own.</p>
<p>He said, nor the Gerenian Chief refused.<br />
Thenceforth their servants, Sthenelus and good<br />
Eurymedon, took charge of Nestor's steeds,<span class="lnm">135</span><br />
And they the chariot of Tydides both<br />
Ascended; Nestor seized the reins, plied well<br />
The scourge, and soon they met. Tydides hurl'd<br />
At Hector first, while rapid he advanced;<br />
But missing Hector, wounded in the breast<span class="lnm">140</span><br />
Eniopeus his charioteer, the son<br />
Of brave Theb&aelig;us, managing the steeds.<br />
He fell; his fiery coursers at the sound<br />
Startled, recoil'd, and where he fell he died.<br />
Deep sorrow for his charioteer o'erwhelm'd<span class="lnm">145</span><br />
The mind of Hector; yet, although he mourn'd<br />
He left him, and another sought as brave.<br />
Nor wanted long his steeds a charioteer,<br />
For finding soon the son of Iphitus,<br />
Bold Archeptolemus, he bade him mount<span class="lnm">150</span><br />
His chariot, and the reins gave to his hand.<br />
Then deeds of bloodiest note should have ensued,<br />
Penn'd had the Trojans been, as lambs, in Troy,<br />
But for quick succor of the sire of all.<br />
Thundering, he downward hurled his candent bolt<span class="lnm">155</span><br />
To the horse-feet of Diomede; dire fumed<br />
The flaming sulphur, and both horses drove<br />
Under the axle, belly to the ground.<br />
Forth flew the splendid reins from Nestor's hand,<br />
And thus to Diomede, appall'd, he spake.<span class="lnm">160</span></p>
<p><span class="pgnm">190</span><a name="page_190" id="page_190"></a>
Back to the fleet, Tydides! Can'st not see<br />
That Jove ordains not, now, the victory thine?<br />
The son of Saturn glorifies to-day<br />
This Trojan, and, if such his will, can make<br />
The morrow ours; but vain it is to thwart<span class="lnm">165</span><br />
The mind of Jove, for he is Lord of all.</p>
<p>To him the valiant Diomede replied.<br />
Thou hast well said, old warrior! but the pang<br />
That wrings my soul, is this. The public ear<br />
In Ilium shall from Hector's lips be told&mdash;<span class="lnm">170</span><br />
I drove Tydides&mdash;fearing me he fled.<br />
So shall he vaunt, and may the earth her jaws<br />
That moment opening swallow me alive!</p>
<p>Him answer'd the Gerenian warrior old.<br />
What saith the son of Tydeus, glorious Chief?<span class="lnm">175</span><br />
Should Hector so traduce thee as to call<br />
Thee base and timid, neither Trojan him<br />
Nor Dardan would believe, nor yet the wives<br />
Of numerous shielded warriors brave of Troy,<br />
Widow'd by thy unconquerable arm.<span class="lnm">180</span></p>
<p>So saying, he through the fugitives his steeds<br />
Turn'd swift to flight. Then Hector and his host<br />
With clamor infinite their darts wo-wing'd<br />
Shower'd after them, and Hector, mighty Chief<br />
Majestic, from afar, thus call'd aloud.<span class="lnm">185</span></p>
<p>Tydides! thee the Dana&iuml; swift-horsed<br />
Were wont to grace with a superior seat,<br />
The mess of honor, and the brimming cup,<br />
But now will mock thee. Thou art woman now.<br />
Go, timorous girl! Thou never shalt behold<span class="lnm">190</span><br />
Me flying, climb our battlements, or lead<br />
Our women captive. I will slay thee first.</p>
<p>He ceased. Then Diomede in dread suspense<br />
Thrice purposed, turning, to withstand the foe,<br />
And thrice in thunder from the mountain-top<span class="lnm">195</span><br />
Jove gave the signal of success to Troy.<br />
When Hector thus the Trojans hail'd aloud.</p>
<p>Trojans and Lycians, and close-warring sons<br />
<span class="pgnm">191</span><a name="page_191" id="page_191"></a>
Of Dardanus, oh summon all your might,<br />
Now, now be men! I know that from his heart<span class="lnm">200</span><br />
Saturnian Jove glory and bright success<br />
For me prepares, but havoc for the Greeks.<br />
Fools! they shall find this wall which they have raised<br />
Too weak to check my course, a feeble guard<br />
Contemptible; such also is the trench;<span class="lnm">205</span><br />
My steeds shall slight it with an easy leap.<br />
But when ye see me in their fleet arrived,<br />
Remember fire. Then bring me flaming brands<br />
That I may burn their galleys and themselves<br />
Slaughter beside them, struggling in the smoke.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_8-8">[8]</a><span class="lnm">210</span></p>
<p>He spake, and thus encouraged next his steeds.<br />
Xanthus! Podargus! and ye generous pair<br />
&AElig;thon and glossy Lampus! now requite<br />
Mine, and the bounty of Andromache,<br />
Far-famed E&euml;tion's daughter; she your bowl<span class="lnm">215</span><br />
With corn fresh-flavor'd and with wine full oft<br />
Hath mingled, your refreshment seeking first<br />
Ere mine, who have a youthful husband's claim.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_8-9">[9]</a><br />
Now follow! now be swift; that we may seize<br />
The shield of Nestor, bruited to the skies<span class="lnm">220</span><br />
As golden all, trappings and disk alike.<br />
Now from the shoulders of the equestrian Chief<br />
Tydides tear we off his splendid mail,<br />
The work of Vulcan.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_8-10">[10]</a> May we take but these,<br />
<span class="pgnm">192</span><a name="page_192" id="page_192"></a>
I have good hope that, ere this night be spent,<span class="lnm">225</span><br />
The Greeks shall climb their galleys and away.</p>
<p>So vaunted he, but Juno with disdain<br />
His proud boast heard, and shuddering in her throne,<br />
Rock'd the Olympian; turning then toward<br />
The Ocean's mighty sovereign, thus she spake.<span class="lnm">230</span></p>
<p>Alas! earth-shaking sovereign of the waves,<br />
Feel'st thou no pity of the perishing Greeks?<br />
Yet Greece, in Helice, with gifts nor few<br />
Nor sordid, and in &AElig;g&aelig;, honors thee,<br />
Whom therefore thou shouldst prosper. Would we all<span class="lnm">235</span><br />
Who favor Greece associate to repulse<br />
The Trojans, and to check loud-thundering Jove,<br />
On Ida seated he might lour alone.</p>
<p>To whom the Sovereign, Shaker of the Shores,<br />
Indignant. Juno! rash in speech! what word<span class="lnm">240</span><br />
Hath 'scaped thy lips? never, with my consent,<br />
Shall we, the powers subordinate, in arms<br />
With Jove contend. He far excels us all.</p>
<p>So they. Meantime, the trench and wall between,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_8-11">[11]</a><br />
The narrow interval with steeds was fill'd<span class="lnm">245</span><br />
Close throng'd and shielded warriors. There immew'd<br />
By Priameian Hector, fierce as Mars,<br />
They stood, for Hector had the help of Jove.<br />
And now with blazing fire their gallant barks<br />
He had consumed, but Juno moved the mind<span class="lnm">250</span><br />
Of Agamemnon, vigilant himself,<br />
To exhortation of Achaia's host.<br />
Through camp and fleet the monarch took his way,<br />
And, his wide robe imperial in his hand,<br />
High on Ulysses' huge black galley stood,<span class="lnm">255</span><br />
The central ship conspicuous; thence his voice<br />
Might reach the most remote of all the line<br />
At each extreme, where Ajax had his tent<br />
<span class="pgnm">193</span><a name="page_193" id="page_193"></a>
Pitch'd, and Achilles, fearless of surprise.<br />
Thence, with loud voice, the Grecians thus he hail'd.<span class="lnm">260</span></p>
<p>Oh shame to Greece! Warriors in show alone!<br />
Where is your boasted prowess? Ye profess'd<br />
Vain-glorious erst in Lemnos, while ye fed<br />
Plenteously on the flesh of beeves full-grown,<br />
And crown'd your beakers high, that ye would face<span class="lnm">265</span><br />
Each man a hundred Trojans in the field&mdash;<br />
Ay, twice a hundred&mdash;yet are all too few<br />
To face one Hector now; nor doubt I aught<br />
But he shall soon fire the whole fleet of Greece.<br />
Jove! Father! what great sovereign ever felt<span class="lnm">270</span><br />
Thy frowns as I? Whom hast thou shamed as me?<br />
Yet I neglected not, through all the course<br />
Of our disasterous voyage (in the hope<br />
That we should vanquish Troy) thy sacred rites,<br />
But where I found thine altar, piled it high<span class="lnm">275</span><br />
With fat and flesh of bulls, on every shore.<br />
But oh, vouchsafe to us, that we at least<br />
Ourselves, deliver'd, may escape the sword,<br />
Nor let their foes thus tread the Grecians down!</p>
<p>He said. The eternal father pitying saw<span class="lnm">280</span><br />
His tears, and for the monarch's sake preserved<br />
The people. Instant, surest of all signs,<br />
He sent his eagle; in his pounces strong<br />
A fawn he bore, fruit of the nimble hind,<br />
Which fast beside the beauteous altar raised<span class="lnm">285</span><br />
To Panomph&aelig;an<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_8-12">[12]</a> Jove sudden he dropp'd.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_8-13">[13]</a></p>
<p>They, conscious, soon, that sent from Jove he came,<br />
More ardent sprang to fight. Then none of all<br />
Those numerous Chiefs could boast that he outstripp'd<br />
Tydides, urging forth beyond the foss<span class="lnm">290</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">194</span><a name="page_194" id="page_194"></a>
His rapid steeds, and rushing to the war.<br />
He, foremost far, a Trojan slew, the son<br />
Of Phradmon, Agel&auml;us; as he turn'd<br />
His steeds to flight, him turning with his spear<br />
Through back and bosom Diomede transpierced.<span class="lnm">295</span><br />
And with loud clangor of his arms he fell.<br />
Then, royal Agamemnon pass'd the trench<br />
And Menelaus; either Ajax, then,<br />
Clad with fresh prowess both; them follow'd, next,<br />
Idomeneus, with his heroic friend<span class="lnm">300</span><br />
In battle dread as homicidal Mars,<br />
Meriones; Ev&aelig;mon's son renown'd<br />
Succeeded, bold Eurypylus; and ninth<br />
Teucer, wide-straining his impatient bow.<br />
He under covert fought of the broad shield<span class="lnm">305</span><br />
Of Telamonian Ajax; Ajax high<br />
Upraised his shield; the hero from beneath<br />
Took aim, and whom his arrow struck, he fell;<br />
Then close as to his mother's side a child<br />
For safety creeps, Teucer to Ajax' side<span class="lnm">310</span><br />
Retired, and Ajax shielded him again.<br />
Whom then slew Teucer first, illustrious Chief?<br />
Orsilochus, and Ophelestes, first,<br />
And Ormenus he slew, then D&aelig;tor died,<br />
Chromius and Lycophontes brave in fight<span class="lnm">315</span><br />
With Amopaon Poly&aelig;mon's son,<br />
And Melanippus. These, together heap'd,<br />
All fell by Teucer on the plain of Troy.<br />
The Trojan ranks thinn'd by his mighty bow<br />
The King of armies Agamemnon saw<span class="lnm">320</span><br />
Well-pleased, and him approaching, thus began.</p>
<p>Brave Telamonian Teucer, oh, my friend,<br />
Thus shoot, that light may visit once again<br />
The Dana&iuml;, and Telamon rejoice!<br />
Thee Telamon within his own abode<span class="lnm">325</span><br />
Rear'd although spurious; mount him, in return,<br />
Although remote, on glory's heights again.<br />
I tell thee, and the effect shall follow sure,<br />
<span class="pgnm">195</span><a name="page_195" id="page_195"></a>
Let but the Thunderer and Minerva grant<br />
The pillage of fair Ilium to the Greeks,<span class="lnm">330</span><br />
And I will give to thy victorious hand,<br />
After my own, the noblest recompense,<br />
A tripod or a chariot with its steeds,<br />
Or some fair captive to partake thy bed.</p>
<p>To whom the generous Teucer thus replied.<span class="lnm">335</span><br />
Atrides! glorious monarch! wherefore me<br />
Exhortest thou to battle? who myself<br />
Glow with sufficient ardor, and such strength<br />
As heaven affords me spare not to employ.<br />
Since first we drove them back, with watchful eye<span class="lnm">340</span><br />
Their warriors I have mark'd; eight shafts my bow<br />
Hath sent long-barb'd, and every shaft, well-aim'd.<br />
The body of some Trojan youth robust<br />
Hath pierced, but still you ravening wolf escapes.</p>
<p>He said, and from the nerve another shaft<span class="lnm">345</span><br />
Impatient sent at Hector; but it flew<br />
Devious, and brave Gorgythion struck instead.<br />
Him beautiful Castianira, brought<br />
By Priam from &AElig;syma, nymph of form<br />
Celestial, to the King of Ilium bore.<span class="lnm">350</span><br />
As in the garden, with the weight surcharged<br />
Of its own fruit, and drench'd by vernal rains<br />
The poppy falls oblique, so he his head<br />
Hung languid, by his helmet's weight depress'd.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_8-14">[14]</a><br />
Then Teucer yet an arrow from the nerve<span class="lnm">355</span><br />
Dispatch'd at Hector, with impatience fired<br />
To pierce him; but again his weapon err'd<br />
Turn'd by Apollo, and the bosom struck<br />
Of Archeptolemus, his rapid steeds<br />
To battle urging, Hector's charioteer.<span class="lnm">360</span><br />
He fell, his fiery coursers at the sound<br />
Recoil'd, and lifeless where he fell he lay.<br />
Deep sorrow for his charioteer the mind<br />
<span class="pgnm">196</span><a name="page_196" id="page_196"></a>
O'erwhelm'd of Hector, yet he left the slain,<br />
And seeing his own brother nigh at hand,<span class="lnm">365</span><br />
Cebriones, him summon'd to the reins,<br />
Who with alacrity that charge received.<br />
Then Hector, leaping with a dreadful shout<br />
From his resplendent chariot, grasp'd a stone,<br />
And rush'd on Teucer, vengeance in his heart.<span class="lnm">370</span><br />
Teucer had newly fitted to the nerve<br />
An arrow keen selected from the rest,<br />
And warlike Hector, while he stood the cord<br />
Retracting, smote him with that rugged rock<br />
Just where the key-bone interposed divides<span class="lnm">375</span><br />
The neck and bosom, a most mortal part.<br />
It snapp'd the bow-string, and with numbing force<br />
Struck dead his hand; low on his knees he dropp'd,<br />
And from his opening grasp let fall the bow.<br />
Then not unmindful of a brother fallen<span class="lnm">380</span><br />
Was Ajax, but, advancing rapid, stalk'd<br />
Around him, and his broad shield interposed,<br />
Till brave Alaster and Mecisteus, son<br />
Of Echius, friends of Teucer, from the earth<br />
Upraised and bore him groaning to the fleet.<span class="lnm">385</span><br />
And now again fresh force Olympian Jove<br />
Gave to the Trojans; right toward the foss<br />
They drove the Greeks, while Hector in the van<br />
Advanced, death menacing in every look.</p>
<p>As some fleet hound close-threatening flank or haunch<span class="lnm">390</span><br />
Of boar or lion, oft as he his head<br />
Turns flying, marks him with a steadfast eye,<br />
So Hector chased the Grecians, slaying still<br />
The hindmost of the scatter'd multitude.<br />
But when, at length, both piles and hollow foss<span class="lnm">395</span><br />
They had surmounted, and no few had fallen<br />
By Trojan hands, within their fleet they stood<br />
Imprison'd, calling each to each, and prayer<br />
With lifted hands, loud offering to the Gods.<br />
With Gorgon looks, meantime, and eyes of Mars,<span class="lnm">400</span><br />
Hector impetuous his mane-tossing steeds<br />
<span class="pgnm">197</span><a name="page_197" id="page_197"></a>
From side to side before the rampart drove,<br />
When white-arm'd Juno pitying the Greeks,<br />
In accents wing'd her speech to Pallas turn'd.</p>
<p>Alas, Jove's daughter! shall not we at least<span class="lnm">405</span><br />
In this extremity of their distress<br />
Care for the Grecians by the fatal force<br />
Of this one Chief destroy'd? I can endure<br />
The rage of Priame&iuml;an Hector now<br />
No longer; such dire mischiefs he hath wrought.<span class="lnm">410</span></p>
<p>Whom answer'd thus Pallas, c&aelig;rulean-eyed.<br />
&mdash;And Hector had himself long since his life<br />
Resign'd and rage together, by the Greeks<br />
Slain under Ilium's walls, but Jove, my sire,<br />
Mad counsels executing and perverse,<span class="lnm">415</span><br />
Me counterworks in all that I attempt,<br />
Nor aught remembers how I saved ofttimes<br />
His son enjoin'd full many a task severe<br />
By King Eurystheus; to the Gods he wept,<br />
And me Jove sent in haste to his relief.<span class="lnm">420</span><br />
But had I then foreseen what now I know,<br />
When through the adamantine gates he pass'd<br />
To bind the dog of hell, by the deep floods<br />
Hemm'd in of Styx, he had return'd no more.<br />
But Thetis wins him now; her will prevails,<span class="lnm">425</span><br />
And mine he hates; for she hath kiss'd his knees<br />
And grasp'd his beard, and him in prayer implored<br />
That he would honor her heroic son<br />
Achilles, city-waster prince renown'd.<br />
'Tis well&mdash;the day shall come when Jove again<span class="lnm">430</span><br />
Shall call me darling, and his blue-eyed maid<br />
As heretofore;&mdash;but thou thy steeds prepare,<br />
While I, my father's mansion entering, arm<br />
For battle. I would learn by trial sure,<br />
If Hector, Priam's offspring famed in fight<span class="lnm">435</span><br />
(Ourselves appearing in the walks of war)<br />
Will greet us gladly. Doubtless at the fleet<br />
Some Trojan also, shall to dogs resign<br />
His flesh for food, and to the fowls of heaven.</p>
<p><span class="pgnm">198</span><a name="page_198" id="page_198"></a>
So counsell'd Pallas, nor the daughter dread<span class="lnm">440</span><br />
Of mighty Saturn, Juno, disapproved,<br />
But busily and with dispatch prepared<br />
The trappings of her coursers golden-rein'd.<br />
Meantime, Minerva progeny of Jove,<br />
On the adamantine floor of his abode<span class="lnm">445</span><br />
Let fall profuse her variegated robe,<br />
Labor of her own hands. She first put on<br />
The corslet of the cloud-assembler God,<br />
Then arm'd her for the field of wo, complete.<br />
Mounting the fiery chariot, next she seized<span class="lnm">450</span><br />
Her ponderous spear, huge, irresistible,<br />
With which Jove's awful daughter levels ranks<br />
Of heroes against whom her anger burns.<br />
Juno with lifted lash urged on the steeds.<br />
At their approach, spontaneous roar'd the wide-<span class="lnm">455</span><br />
Unfolding gates of heaven; the heavenly gates<br />
Kept by the watchful Hours, to whom the charge<br />
Of the Olympian summit appertains,<br />
And of the boundless ether, back to roll,<br />
And to replace the cloudy barrier dense.<span class="lnm">460</span><br />
Spurr'd through the portal flew the rapid steeds:<br />
Which when the Eternal Father from the heights<br />
Of Ida saw, kindling with instant ire<br />
To golden-pinion'd Iris thus he spake.</p>
<p>Haste, Iris, turn them thither whence they came;<span class="lnm">465</span><br />
Me let them not encounter; honor small<br />
To them, to me, should from that strife accrue.<br />
Tell them, and the effect shall sure ensue,<br />
That I will smite their steeds, and they shall halt<br />
Disabled; break their chariot, dash themselves<span class="lnm">470</span><br />
Headlong, and ten whole years shall not efface<br />
The wounds by my avenging bolts impress'd.<br />
So shall my blue-eyed daughter learn to dread<br />
A father's anger; but for the offence<br />
Of Juno, I resent it less; for she<span class="lnm">475</span><br />
Clashes<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_8-15">[15]</a> with all my counsels from of old.<br />
<span class="pgnm">199</span><a name="page_199" id="page_199"></a>
He ended; Iris with a tempest's speed<br />
From the Id&aelig;an summit soar'd at once<br />
To the Olympian; at the open gates<br />
Exterior of the mountain many-valed<span class="lnm">480</span><br />
She stayed them, and her coming thus declared.</p>
<p>Whither, and for what cause? What rage is this?<br />
Ye may not aid the Grecians; Jove forbids;<br />
The son of Saturn threatens, if ye force<br />
His wrath by perseverance into act,<span class="lnm">485</span><br />
That he will smite your steeds, and they shall halt<br />
Disabled; break your chariot, dash yourselves<br />
Headlong, and ten whole years shall not efface<br />
The wounds by his avenging bolts impress'd.<br />
So shall his blue-eyed daughter learn to dread<span class="lnm">490</span><br />
A father's anger; but for the offence<br />
Of Juno, he resents it less; for she<br />
Clashes with all his counsels from of old.<br />
But thou, Minerva, if thou dare indeed<br />
Lift thy vast spear against the breast of Jove,<span class="lnm">495</span><br />
Incorrigible art and dead to shame.</p>
<p>So saying, the rapid Iris disappear'd,<br />
And thus her speech to Pallas Juno turn'd.</p>
<p>Ah Pallas, progeny of Jove! henceforth<br />
No longer, in the cause of mortal men,<span class="lnm">500</span><br />
Contend we against Jove. Perish or live<br />
Grecians or Trojans as he wills; let him<br />
Dispose the order of his own concerns,<br />
And judge between them, as of right he may.</p>
<p>So saying, she turn'd the coursers; them the Hours<span class="lnm">505</span><br />
Released, and to ambrosial mangers bound,<br />
Then thrust their chariot to the luminous wall.<br />
They, mingling with the Gods, on golden thrones<br />
Dejected sat, and Jove from Ida borne<br />
Reach'd the Olympian heights, seat of the Gods.<span class="lnm">510</span><br />
His steeds the glorious King of Ocean loosed,<br />
And thrust the chariot, with its veil o'erspread.<br />
Into its station at the altar's side.<br />
Then sat the Thunderer on his throne of gold<br />
<span class="pgnm">200</span><a name="page_200" id="page_200"></a>
Himself, and the huge mountain shook. Meantime<span class="lnm">515</span><br />
Juno and Pallas, seated both apart,<br />
Spake not or question'd him. Their mute reserve<br />
He noticed, conscious of the cause, and said.</p>
<p>Juno and Pallas, wherefore sit ye sad?<br />
Not through fatigue by glorious fight incurr'd<span class="lnm">520</span><br />
And slaughter of the Trojans whom ye hate.<br />
Mark now the difference. Not the Gods combined<br />
Should have constrain'd <i>me</i> back, till all my force,<br />
Superior as it is, had fail'd, and all<br />
My fortitude. But ye, ere ye beheld<span class="lnm">525</span><br />
The wonders of the field, trembling retired.<br />
And ye did well&mdash;Hear what had else befallen.<br />
My bolts had found you both, and ye had reach'd,<br />
In your own chariot borne, the Olympian height,<br />
Seat of the blest Immortals, never more.<span class="lnm">530</span></p>
<p>He ended; Juno and Minerva heard<br />
Low murmuring deep disgust, and side by side<br />
Devising sat calamity to Troy.<br />
Minerva, through displeasure against Jove,<br />
Nought utter'd, for her bosom boil'd with rage;<span class="lnm">535</span><br />
But Juno check'd not hers, who thus replied.</p>
<p>What word hath pass'd thy lips, Jove most severe?<br />
We know thy force resistless; yet our hearts<br />
Feel not the less when we behold the Greeks<br />
Exhausting all the sorrows of their lot.<span class="lnm">540</span><br />
If thou command, we doubtless will abstain<br />
From battle, yet such counsel to the Greeks<br />
Suggesting still, as may in part effect<br />
Their safety, lest thy wrath consume them all.</p>
<p>Then answer, thus, cloud-gatherer Jove return'd.<span class="lnm">545</span><br />
Look forth, imperial Juno, if thou wilt,<br />
To-morrow at the blush of earliest dawn,<br />
And thou shalt see Saturn's almighty son<br />
The Argive host destroying far and wide.<br />
For Hector's fury shall admit no pause<span class="lnm">550</span><br />
Till he have roused Achilles, in that day<br />
When at the ships, in perilous straits, the hosts<br />
<span class="pgnm">201</span><a name="page_201" id="page_201"></a>
Shall wage fierce battle for Patroclus slain.<br />
Such is the voice of fate. But, as for thee&mdash;<br />
Withdraw thou to the confines of the abyss<span class="lnm">555</span><br />
Where Saturn and I&auml;petus retired,<br />
Exclusion sad endure from balmy airs<br />
And from the light of morn, hell-girt around,<br />
I will not call thee thence. No. Should thy rage<br />
Transport thee thither, there thou may'st abide,<span class="lnm">560</span><br />
There sullen nurse thy disregarded spleen<br />
Obstinate as thou art, and void of shame.</p>
<p>He ended; to whom Juno nought replied.<br />
And now the radiant Sun in Ocean sank,<br />
Drawing night after him o'er all the earth;<span class="lnm">565</span><br />
Night, undesired by Troy, but to the Greeks<br />
Thrice welcome for its interposing gloom.</p>
<p>Then Hector on the river's brink fast by<br />
The Grecian fleet, where space he found unstrew'd<br />
With carcases convened the Chiefs of Troy.<span class="lnm">570</span><br />
They, there dismounting, listen'd to the words<br />
Of Hector Jove-beloved; he grasp'd a spear<br />
In length eleven cubits, bright its head<br />
Of brass, and color'd with a ring of gold.<br />
He lean'd on it, and ardent thus began.<span class="lnm">575</span></p>
<p>Trojans, Dardanians, and allies of Troy!<br />
I hoped, this evening (every ship consumed,<br />
And all the Grecians slain) to have return'd<br />
To wind-swept Ilium. But the shades of night<br />
Have intervened, and to the night they owe,<span class="lnm">580</span><br />
In chief, their whole fleet's safety and their own.<br />
Now, therefore, as the night enjoins, all take<br />
Needful refreshment. Your high-mettled steeds<br />
Release, lay food before them, and in haste<br />
Drive hither from the city fatted sheep<span class="lnm">585</span><br />
And oxen; bring ye from your houses bread,<br />
Make speedy purchase of heart-cheering wine,<br />
And gather fuel plenteous; that all night,<br />
E'en till Aurora, daughter of the morn<br />
Shall look abroad, we may with many fires<span class="lnm">590</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">202</span><a name="page_202" id="page_202"></a>
Illume the skies; lest even in the night,<br />
Launching, they mount the billows and escape.<br />
Beware that they depart not unannoy'd,<br />
But, as he leaps on board, give each a wound<br />
With shaft or spear, which he shall nurse at home.<span class="lnm">595</span><br />
So shall the nations fear us, and shall vex<br />
With ruthless war Troy's gallant sons no more.<br />
Next, let the heralds, ministers of Jove,<br />
Loud notice issue that the boys well-grown,<br />
And ancients silver-hair'd on the high towers<span class="lnm">600</span><br />
Built by the Gods, keep watch; on every hearth<br />
In Troy, let those of the inferior sex<br />
Make sprightly blaze, and place ye there a guard<br />
Sufficient, lest in absence of the troops<br />
An ambush enter, and surprise the town.<span class="lnm">605</span><br />
Act thus, ye dauntless Trojans; the advice<br />
Is wholesome, and shall serve the present need,<br />
And so much for the night; ye shall be told<br />
The business of the morn when morn appears.<br />
It is my prayer to Jove and to all heaven<span class="lnm">610</span><br />
(Not without hope) that I may hence expel<br />
These dogs, whom Ilium's unpropitious fates<br />
Have wafted hither in their sable barks.<br />
But we will also watch this night, ourselves,<br />
And, arming with the dawn, will at their ships<span class="lnm">615</span><br />
Give them brisk onset. Then shall it appear<br />
If Diomede the brave shall me compel<br />
Back to our walls, or I, his arms blood-stain'd,<br />
Torn from his breathless body, bear away.<br />
To-morrow, if he dare but to abide<span class="lnm">620</span><br />
My lance, he shall not want occasion meet<br />
For show of valor. But much more I judge<br />
That the next rising sun shall see him slain<br />
With no few friends around him. Would to heaven!<br />
I were as sure to 'scape the blight of age<span class="lnm">625</span><br />
And share their honors with the Gods above,<br />
As comes the morrow fraught with wo to Greece.</p>
<p>So Hector, whom his host with loud acclaim<br />
<span class="pgnm">203</span><a name="page_203" id="page_203"></a>
All praised. Then each his sweating steeds released,<br />
And rein'd them safely at his chariot-side.<span class="lnm">630</span><br />
And now from Troy provision large they brought,<br />
Oxen, and sheep, with store of wine and bread,<br />
And fuel much was gather'd. <a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_8-16">[16]</a>Next the Gods<br />
With sacrifice they sought, and from the plain<br />
Upwafted by the winds the smoke aspired<span class="lnm">635</span><br />
Savoury, but unacceptable to those<br />
Above; such hatred in their hearts they bore<br />
To Priam, to the people of the brave<br />
Spear-practised Priam, and to sacred Troy.</p>
<p>Big with great purposes and proud, they sat,<span class="lnm">640</span><br />
Not disarray'd, but in fair form disposed<br />
Of even ranks, and watch'd their numerous fires,<br />
As when around the clear bright moon, the stars<br />
Shine in full splendor, and the winds are hush'd,<br />
The groves, the mountain-tops, the headland-heights<span class="lnm">645</span><br />
Stand all apparent, not a vapor streaks<br />
The boundless blue, but ether open'd wide<br />
All glitters, and the shepherd's heart is cheer'd;<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_8-17">[17]</a><br />
So numerous seem'd those fires the bank between<br />
Of Xanthus, blazing, and the fleet of Greece,<span class="lnm">650</span><br />
In prospect all of Troy; a thousand fires,<br />
Each watch'd by fifty warriors seated near.<br />
The steeds beside the chariots stood, their corn<br />
Chewing, and waiting till the golden-throned<br />
Aurora should restore the light of day.<span class="lnm">655</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="noind">So watch'd the Trojan host; but thoughts of flight,<br />
Companions of chill fear, from heaven infused,<br />
Possess'd the Grecians; every leader's heart<br />
Bled, pierced with anguish insupportable.<br />
As when two adverse winds blowing from Thrace,<span class="lnm">5</span><br />
Boreas and Zephyrus, the fishy Deep<br />
Vex sudden, all around, the sable flood<br />
High curl'd, flings forth the salt weed on the shore<br />
Such tempest rent the mind of every Greek.</p>
<p>  Forth stalk'd Atrides with heart-riving wo<span class="lnm">10</span><br />
Transfixt; he bade his heralds call by name<br />
Each Chief to council, but without the sound<br />
Of proclamation; and that task himself<br />
Among the foremost sedulous perform'd.<br />
The sad assembly sat; when weeping fast<span class="lnm">15</span><br />
As some deep<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_9-1">[1]</a> fountain pours its rapid stream<br />
Down from the summit of a lofty rock,<br />
King Agamemnon in the midst arose,<br />
And, groaning, the Achaians thus address'd.</p>
<p>  Friends, counsellors and leaders of the Greeks!<span class="lnm">20</span><br />
In dire perplexity Saturnian Jove<br />
Involves me, cruel; he assured me erst,<br />
<span class="pgnm">208</span><a name="page_208" id="page_208"></a>
And solemnly, that I should not return<br />
Till I had wasted wall-encircled Troy;<br />
But now (ah fraudulent and foul reverse!)<span class="lnm">25</span><br />
Commands me back inglorious to the shores<br />
Of distant Argos, with diminish'd troops.<br />
So stands the purpose of almighty Jove,<br />
Who many a citadel hath laid in dust,<br />
And shall hereafter, matchless in his power.<span class="lnm">30</span><br />
Haste therefore. My advice is, that we all<br />
Fly with our fleet into our native land,<br />
For wide-built Ilium shall not yet be ours.</p>
<p>  He ceased, and all sat silent; long the sons<br />
Of Greece, o'erwhelm'd with sorrow, silent sat,<span class="lnm">35</span><br />
When thus, at last, bold Diomede began.</p>
<p>  Atrides! foremost of the Chiefs I rise<br />
To contravert thy purpose ill-conceived,<br />
And with such freedom as the laws, O King!<br />
Of consultation and debate allow.<span class="lnm">40</span><br />
Hear patient. Thou hast been thyself the first<br />
Who e'er reproach'd me in the public ear<br />
As one effeminate and slow to fight;<br />
How truly, let both young and old decide.<br />
The son of wily Saturn hath to thee<span class="lnm">45</span><br />
Given, and refused; he placed thee high in power,<br />
Gave thee to sway the sceptre o'er us all,<br />
But courage gave thee not, his noblest gift.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_9-2">[2]</a><br />
Art thou in truth persuaded that the Greeks<br />
Are pusillanimous, as thou hast said?<span class="lnm">50</span><br />
If thy own fears impel thee to depart,<br />
Go thou, the way is open; numerous ships,<br />
Thy followers from Mycen&aelig;, line the shore.<br />
But we, the rest, depart not, 'till the spoil<br />
Of Troy reward us. Or if all incline<span class="lnm">55</span><br />
To seek again their native home, fly all;<br />
Myself and Sthenelus will persevere<br />
<span class="pgnm">209</span><a name="page_209" id="page_209"></a>
Till Ilium fall, for with the Gods we came.</p>
<p>  He ended; all the admiring sons of Greece<br />
With shouts the warlike Diomede extoll'd,<span class="lnm">60</span><br />
When thus equestrian Nestor next began.</p>
<p>  Tydides, thou art eminently brave<br />
In fight, and all the princes of thy years<br />
Excell'st in council. None of all the Greeks<br />
Shall find occasion just to blame thy speech<span class="lnm">65</span><br />
Or to gainsay; yet thou hast fallen short.<br />
What wonder? Thou art young; and were myself<br />
Thy father, thou should'st be my latest born.<br />
Yet when thy speech is to the Kings of Greece,<br />
It is well-framed and prudent. Now attend!<span class="lnm">70</span><br />
Myself will speak, who have more years to boast<br />
Than thou hast seen, and will so closely scan<br />
The matter, that Atrides, our supreme,<br />
Himself shall have no cause to censure <i>me</i>.<br />
He is a wretch, insensible and dead<span class="lnm">75</span><br />
To all the charities of social life,<br />
Whose pleasure is in civil broils alone.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_9-3">[3]</a><br />
But Night is urgent, and with Night's demands<br />
Let all comply. Prepare we now repast,<br />
And let the guard be stationed at the trench<span class="lnm">80</span><br />
Without the wall; the youngest shall supply<br />
That service; next, Atrides, thou begin<br />
(For thou art here supreme) thy proper task.<br />
Banquet the elders; it shall not disgrace<br />
Thy sovereignty, but shall become thee well.<span class="lnm">85</span><br />
Thy tents are fill'd with wine which day by day<br />
Ships bring from Thrace; accommodation large<br />
Hast thou, and numerous is thy menial train.<br />
Thy many guests assembled, thou shalt hear<br />
Our counsel, and shalt choose the best; great need<span class="lnm">90</span><br />
Have all Achaia's sons, now, of advice<br />
<span class="pgnm">210</span><a name="page_210" id="page_210"></a>
Most prudent; for the foe, fast by the fleet<br />
Hath kindled numerous fires, which who can see<br />
Unmoved? This night shall save us or destroy.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_9-4">[4]</a></p>
<p>  He spake, whom all with full consent approved.<span class="lnm">95</span><br />
Forth rush'd the guard well-arm'd; first went the son<br />
Of Nestor, Thrasymedes, valiant Chief;<br />
Then, sons of Mars, Ascalaphus advanced,<br />
And brave I&auml;lmenus; whom follow'd next<br />
Deipyrus, Aphareus, Meriones,<span class="lnm">100</span><br />
And Lycomedes, Creon's son renown'd.<br />
Seven were the leaders of the guard, and each<br />
A hundred spearmen headed, young and bold.<br />
Between the wall and trench their seat they chose,<br />
There kindled fires, and each his food prepared.<span class="lnm">105</span></p>
<p>  Atrides, then, to his pavilion led<br />
The thronging Chiefs of Greece, and at his board<br />
Regaled them; they with readiness and keen<br />
Dispatch of hunger shared the savory feast,<br />
And when nor thirst remain'd nor hunger more<span class="lnm">110</span><br />
Unsated, Nestor then, arising first,<br />
Whose counsels had been ever wisest deem'd,<br />
Warm for the public interest, thus began.</p>
<p>  Atrides! glorious sovereign! King of men!<br />
Thou art my first and last, proem and close,<span class="lnm">115</span><br />
For thou art mighty, and to thee are given<br />
From Jove the sceptre and the laws in charge,<br />
For the advancement of the general good.<br />
Hence, in peculiar, both to speak and hear<br />
Become thy duty, and the best advice,<span class="lnm">120</span><br />
By whomsoever offer'd, to adopt<br />
And to perform, for thou art judge alone.<br />
I will promulge the counsel which to me<br />
Seems wisest; such, that other Grecian none<br />
<span class="pgnm">211</span><a name="page_211" id="page_211"></a>
Shall give thee better; neither is it new,<span class="lnm">125</span><br />
But I have ever held it since the day<br />
When, most illustrious! thou wast pleased to take<br />
By force the maid Brise&iuml;s from the tent<br />
Of the enraged Achilles; not, in truth,<br />
By my advice, who did dissuade thee much;<span class="lnm">130</span><br />
But thou, complying with thy princely wrath,<br />
Hast shamed a Hero whom themselves the Gods<br />
Delight to honor, and his prize detain'st.<br />
Yet even now contrive we, although late,<br />
By lenient gifts liberal, and by speech<span class="lnm">135</span><br />
Conciliatory, to assuage his ire.</p>
<p>  Then answer'd Agamemnon, King of men.<br />
Old Chief! there is no falsehood in thy charge;<br />
I have offended, and confess the wrong.<br />
The warrior is alone a host, whom Jove<span class="lnm">140</span><br />
Loves as he loves Achilles, for whose sake<br />
He hath Achaia's thousands thus subdued.<br />
But if the impulse of a wayward mind<br />
Obeying, I have err'd, behold me, now,<br />
Prepared to soothe him with atonement large<span class="lnm">145</span><br />
Of gifts inestimable, which by name<br />
I will propound in presence of you all.<br />
Seven tripods, never sullied yet with fire;<br />
Of gold ten talents; twenty cauldrons bright;<br />
Twelve coursers, strong, victorious in the race;<span class="lnm">150</span><br />
No man possessing prizes such as mine<br />
Which they have won for me, shall feel the want<br />
Of acquisitions splendid or of gold.<br />
Seven virtuous female captives will I give<br />
Expert in arts domestic, Lesbians all,<span class="lnm">155</span><br />
Whom, when himself took Lesbos, I received<br />
My chosen portion, passing womankind<br />
In perfect loveliness of face and form.<br />
These will I give, and will with these resign<br />
Her whom I took, Brise&iuml;s, with an oath<span class="lnm">160</span><br />
Most solemn, that unconscious as she was<br />
Of my embraces, such I yield her his.<br />
<span class="pgnm">212</span><a name="page_212" id="page_212"></a>
All these I give him now; and if at length<br />
The Gods vouchsafe to us to overturn<br />
Priam's great city, let him heap his ships<span class="lnm">165</span><br />
With gold and brass, entering and choosing first<br />
When we shall share the spoil. Let him beside<br />
Choose twenty from among the maids of Troy,<br />
Helen except, loveliest of all their sex.<br />
And if once more, the rich milk-flowing land<span class="lnm">170</span><br />
We reach of Argos, he shall there become<br />
My son-in-law, and shall enjoy like state<br />
With him whom I in all abundance rear,<br />
My only son Orestes. At my home<br />
I have three daughters; let him thence conduct<span class="lnm">175</span><br />
To Phthia, her whom he shall most approve.<br />
Chrysothemis shall be his bride, or else<br />
Laodice; or if she please him more,<br />
Iphianassa; and from him I ask<br />
No dower;<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_9-5">[5]</a> myself will such a dower bestow<span class="lnm">180</span><br />
As never father on his child before.<br />
Seven fair well-peopled cities I will give<br />
Cardamyle and Enope, and rich<br />
In herbage, Hira; Pher&aelig; stately-built,<br />
And for her depth of pasturage renown'd<span class="lnm">185</span><br />
Antheia; proud &AElig;peia's lofty towers,<br />
And Pedasus impurpled dark with vines.<br />
All these are maritime, and on the shore<br />
They stand of Pylus, by a race possess'd<br />
Most rich in flocks and herds, who tributes large,<span class="lnm">190</span><br />
And gifts presenting to his sceptred hand,<br />
Shall hold him high in honor as a God.<br />
These will I give him if from wrath he cease.<br />
Let him be overcome. Pluto alone<br />
Is found implacable and deaf to prayer,<span class="lnm">195</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">213</span><a name="page_213" id="page_213"></a>
Whom therefore of all Gods men hate the most.<br />
My power is greater, and my years than his<br />
More numerous, therefore let him yield to me.</p>
<p>  To him Gerenian Nestor thus replied.<br />
Atrides! glorious sovereign! King of men!<span class="lnm">200</span><br />
No sordid gifts, or to be view'd with scorn,<br />
Givest thou the Prince Achilles. But away!<br />
Send chosen messengers, who shall the son<br />
Of Peleus, instant, in his tent address.<br />
Myself will choose them, be it theirs to obey.<span class="lnm">205</span><br />
Let Ph&oelig;nix lead, Jove loves him. Be the next<br />
Huge Ajax; and the wise Ulysses third.<br />
Of heralds, Odius and Eurybates<br />
Shall them attend. Bring water for our hands;<br />
Give charge that every tongue abstain from speech<span class="lnm">210</span><br />
Portentous, and propitiate Jove by prayer.</p>
<p>  He spake, and all were pleased. The heralds pour'd<br />
Pure water on their hands;<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_9-6">[6]</a> attendant youths<br />
The beakers crown'd, and wine from right to left<br />
Distributed to all. Libation made,<span class="lnm">215</span><br />
All drank, and in such measure as they chose,<br />
Then hasted forth from Agamemnon's tent.<br />
Gerenian Nestor at their side them oft<br />
Instructed, each admonishing by looks<br />
Significant, and motion of his eyes,<span class="lnm">220</span><br />
But most Ulysses, to omit no means<br />
By which Achilles likeliest might be won.<br />
Along the margin of the sounding deep<br />
They pass'd, to Neptune, compasser of earth,<br />
Preferring vows ardent with numerous prayers,<span class="lnm">225</span><br />
That they might sway with ease the mighty mind<br />
Of fierce &AElig;acides. And now they reach'd<br />
The station where his Myrmidons abode.<br />
Him solacing they found his heart with notes<br />
Struck from his silver-framed harmonious lyre;<span class="lnm">230</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">214</span><a name="page_214" id="page_214"></a>
Among the spoils he found it when he sack'd<br />
E&euml;tion's city; with that lyre his cares<br />
He sooth'd, and glorious heroes were his theme.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_9-7">[7]</a><br />
Patroclus silent sat, and he alone,<br />
Before him, on &AElig;acides intent,<span class="lnm">235</span><br />
Expecting still when he should cease to sing.<br />
The messengers advanced (Ulysses first)<br />
Into his presence; at the sight, his harp<br />
Still in his hand, Achilles from his seat<br />
Started astonish'd; nor with less amaze<span class="lnm">240</span><br />
Patroclus also, seeing them, arose.<br />
Achilles seized their hands, and thus he spake.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_9-8">[8]</a></p>
<p><span class="pgnm">215</span><a name="page_215" id="page_215"></a>
  Hail friends! ye all are welcome. Urgent cause<br />
Hath doubtless brought you, whom I dearest hold<br />
(Though angry still) of all Achaia's host.<span class="lnm">245</span></p>
<p>  So saying, he introduced them, and on seats<br />
Placed them with purple arras overspread,<br />
Then thus bespake Patroclus standing nigh.</p>
<p>  Son of Men&aelig;tius! bring a beaker more<br />
Capacious, and replenish it with wine<span class="lnm">250</span><br />
Diluted<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_9-9">[9]</a> less; then give to each his cup;<br />
For dearer friends than these who now arrive<br />
My roof beneath, or worthier, have I none.</p>
<p>  He ended, and Patroclus quick obey'd,<br />
Whom much he loved. Achilles, then, himself<span class="lnm">255</span><br />
Advancing near the fire an ample<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_9-10">[10]</a> tray,<br />
Spread goats' flesh on it, with the flesh of sheep<br />
And of a fatted brawn; of each a chine.<br />
Automedon attending held them fast,<br />
While with sharp steel Achilles from the bone<span class="lnm">260</span><br />
Sliced thin the meat, then pierced it with the spits.<br />
Meantime the godlike Men&aelig;tiades<br />
Kindled fierce fire, and when the flame declined,<br />
Raked wide the embers, laid the meat to roast,<br />
And taking sacred salt from the hearth-side<span class="lnm">265</span><br />
Where it was treasured, shower'd it o'er the feast.<br />
When all was finish'd, and the board set forth,<br />
<span class="pgnm">216</span><a name="page_216" id="page_216"></a>
Patroclus furnish'd it around with bread<br />
In baskets, and Achilles served the guests.<br />
Beside the tent-wall, opposite, he sat<span class="lnm">270</span><br />
To the divine Ulysses; first he bade<br />
Patroclus make oblation; he consign'd<br />
The consecrated morsel to the fire,<br />
And each, at once, his savoury mess assail'd.<br />
When neither edge of hunger now they felt<span class="lnm">275</span><br />
Nor thirsted longer, Ajax with a nod<br />
Made sign to Ph&oelig;nix, which Ulysses mark'd,<br />
And charging high his cup, drank to his host.</p>
<p>  Health to Achilles! hospitable cheer<br />
And well prepared, we want not at the board<span class="lnm">280</span><br />
Of royal Agamemnon, or at thine,<br />
For both are nobly spread; but dainties now,<br />
Or plenteous boards, are little our concern.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_9-11">[11]</a><br />
Oh godlike Chief! tremendous ills we sit<br />
Contemplating with fear, doubtful if life<span class="lnm">285</span><br />
Or death, with the destruction of our fleet,<br />
Attend us, unless thou put on thy might.<br />
For lo! the haughty Trojans, with their friends<br />
Call'd from afar, at the fleet-side encamp,<br />
Fast by the wall, where they have kindled fires<span class="lnm">290</span><br />
Numerous, and threaten that no force of ours<br />
Shall check their purposed inroad on the ships.<br />
Jove grants them favorable signs from heaven,<br />
Bright lightnings; Hector glares revenge, with rage<br />
Infuriate, and by Jove assisted, heeds<span class="lnm">295</span><br />
Nor God nor man, but prays the morn to rise<br />
That he may hew away our vessel-heads,<br />
Burn all our fleet with fire, and at their sides<br />
Slay the Achaians struggling in the smoke.<br />
Horrible are my fears lest these his threats<span class="lnm">300</span><br />
The Gods accomplish, and it be our doom<br />
<span class="pgnm">217</span><a name="page_217" id="page_217"></a>
To perish here, from Argos far remote.<br />
Up, therefore! if thou canst, and now at last<br />
The weary sons of all Achaia save<br />
From Trojan violence. Regret, but vain,<span class="lnm">305</span><br />
Shall else be thine hereafter, when no cure<br />
Of such great ill, once suffer'd, can be found.<br />
Thou therefore, seasonably kind, devise<br />
Means to preserve from such disast'rous fate<br />
The Grecians. Ah, my friend! when Peleus thee<span class="lnm">310</span><br />
From Phthia sent to Agamemnon's aid,<br />
On that same day he gave thee thus in charge.<br />
"Juno, my son, and Pallas, if they please,<br />
Can make thee valiant; but thy own big heart<br />
Thyself restrain. Sweet manners win respect.<span class="lnm">315</span><br />
Cease from pernicious strife, and young and old<br />
Throughout the host shall honor thee the more."<br />
Such was thy father's charge, which thou, it seems,<br />
Remember'st not. Yet even now thy wrath<br />
Renounce; be reconciled; for princely gifts<span class="lnm">320</span><br />
Atrides gives thee if thy wrath subside.<br />
Hear, if thou wilt, and I will tell thee all,<br />
How vast the gifts which Agamemnon made<br />
By promise thine, this night within his tent.<br />
Seven tripods never sullied yet with fire;<span class="lnm">325</span><br />
Of gold ten talents; twenty cauldrons bright;<br />
Twelve steeds strong-limb'd, victorious in the race;<br />
No man possessing prizes such as those<br />
Which they have won for him, shall feel the want<br />
Of acquisitions splendid, or of gold.<span class="lnm">330</span><br />
Seven virtuous female captives he will give,<br />
Expert in arts domestic, Lesbians all,<br />
Whom when thou conquer'dst Lesbos, he received<br />
His chosen portion, passing woman-kind<br />
In perfect loveliness of face and form.<span class="lnm">335</span><br />
These will he give, and will with these resign<br />
Her whom he took, Brise&iuml;s, with an oath<br />
Most solemn, that unconscious as she was<br />
Of his embraces, such he yields her back.<br />
<span class="pgnm">218</span><a name="page_218" id="page_218"></a>
All these he gives thee now! and if at length<span class="lnm">340</span><br />
The Gods vouchsafe to us to overturn<br />
Priam's great city, thou shalt heap thy ships<br />
With gold and brass, entering and choosing first,<br />
When we shall share the spoil; and shalt beside<br />
Choose twenty from among the maids of Troy,<span class="lnm">345</span><br />
Helen except, loveliest of all their sex.<br />
And if once more the rich milk-flowing land<br />
We reach of Argos, thou shalt there become<br />
His son-in-law, and shalt enjoy like state<br />
With him, whom he in all abundance rears,<span class="lnm">350</span><br />
His only son Orestes. In his house<br />
He hath three daughters; thou may'st home conduct<br />
To Phthia, her whom thou shalt most approve.<br />
Chrysothemis shall be thy bride; or else<br />
Laodice; or if she please thee more<span class="lnm">355</span><br />
Iphianassa; and from thee he asks<br />
No dower; himself will such a dower bestow<br />
As never father on his child before.<br />
Seven fair well-peopled cities will he give;<br />
Cardamyle and Enope; and rich<span class="lnm">360</span><br />
In herbage, Hira; Pher&aelig; stately-built,<br />
And for her depth of pasturage renown'd,<br />
Antheia; proud &AElig;peia's lofty towers,<br />
And Pedasus impurpled dark with vines.<br />
All these are maritime, and on the shore<span class="lnm">365</span><br />
They stand of Pylus, by a race possess'd<br />
Most rich in flocks and herds, who tribute large<br />
And gifts presenting to thy sceptred hand,<br />
Shall hold thee high in honor as a God.<br />
These will he give thee, if thy wrath subside.<span class="lnm">370</span></p>
<p>  But should'st thou rather in thine heart the more<br />
Both Agamemnon and his gifts detest,<br />
Yet oh compassionate the afflicted host<br />
Prepared to adore thee. Thou shalt win renown<br />
Among the Grecians that shall never die.<span class="lnm">375</span><br />
Now strike at Hector. He is here;&mdash;himself<br />
Provokes thee forth; madness is in his heart,<br />
<span class="pgnm">219</span><a name="page_219" id="page_219"></a>
And in his rage he glories that our ships<br />
Have hither brought no Grecian brave as he.</p>
<p>  Then thus Achilles matchless in the race.<span class="lnm">380</span><br />
Laertes' noble son, for wiles renown'd!<br />
I must with plainness speak my fixt resolve<br />
Unalterable; lest I hear from each<br />
The same long murmur'd melancholy tale.<br />
For I abhor the man, not more the gates<span class="lnm">385</span><br />
Of hell itself, whose words belie his heart.<br />
So shall not mine. My judgment undisguised<br />
Is this; that neither Agamemnon me<br />
Nor all the Greeks shall move; for ceaseless toil<br />
Wins here no thanks; one recompense awaits<span class="lnm">390</span><br />
The sedentary and the most alert,<br />
The brave and base in equal honor stand,<br />
And drones and heroes fall unwept alike.<br />
I after all my labors, who exposed<br />
My life continual in the field, have earn'd<span class="lnm">395</span><br />
No very sumptuous prize. As the poor bird<br />
Gives to her unfledged brood a morsel gain'd<br />
After long search, though wanting it herself,<br />
So I have worn out many sleepless nights,<br />
And waded deep through many a bloody day<span class="lnm">400</span><br />
In battle for their wives.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_9-12">[12]</a> I have destroy'd<br />
Twelve cities with my fleet, and twelve, save one,<br />
On foot contending in the fields of Troy.<br />
From all these cities, precious spoils I took<br />
Abundant, and to Agamemnon's hand<span class="lnm">405</span><br />
Gave all the treasure. He within his ships<br />
Abode the while, and having all received,<br />
Little distributed, and much retained;<br />
He gave, however, to the Kings and Chiefs<br />
A portion, and they keep it. Me alone<span class="lnm">410</span><br />
Of all the Grecian host he hath despoil'd;<br />
My bride, my soul's delight is in his hands,<br />
And let him, couch'd with her, enjoy his fill<br />
<span class="pgnm">220</span><a name="page_220" id="page_220"></a>
Of dalliance. What sufficient cause, what need<br />
Have the Achaians to contend with Troy?<span class="lnm">415</span><br />
Why hath Atrides gather'd such a host,<br />
And led them hither? Was't not for the sake<br />
Of beauteous Helen? And of all mankind<br />
Can none be found who love their proper wives<br />
But the Atrid&aelig;? There is no good man<span class="lnm">420</span><br />
Who loves not, guards not, and with care provides<br />
For his own wife, and, though in battle won,<br />
I loved the fair Brise&iuml;s at my heart.<br />
But having dispossess'd me of my prize<br />
So foully, let him not essay me now,<span class="lnm">425</span><br />
For I am warn'd, and he shall not prevail.<br />
With thee and with thy peers let him advise,<br />
Ulysses! how the fleet may likeliest 'scape<br />
Yon hostile fires; full many an arduous task<br />
He hath accomplished without aid of mine;<span class="lnm">430</span><br />
So hath he now this rampart and the trench<br />
Which he hath digg'd around it, and with stakes<br />
Planted contiguous&mdash;puny barriers all<br />
To hero-slaughtering Hector's force opposed.<br />
While I the battle waged, present myself<span class="lnm">435</span><br />
Among the Achaians, Hector never fought<br />
Far from his walls, but to the Sc&aelig;an gate<br />
Advancing and the beech-tree, there remain'd.<br />
Once, on that spot he met me, and my arm<br />
Escaped with difficulty even there.<span class="lnm">440</span><br />
But, since I feel myself not now inclined<br />
To fight with noble Hector, yielding first<br />
To Jove due worship, and to all the Gods,<br />
To-morrow will I launch, and give my ships<br />
Their lading. Look thou forth at early dawn,<span class="lnm">445</span><br />
And, if such spectacle delight thee aught,<br />
Thou shalt behold me cleaving with my prows<br />
The waves of Hellespont, and all my crews<br />
Of lusty rowers active in their task.<br />
So shall I reach (if Ocean's mighty God<span class="lnm">450</span><br />
Prosper my passage) Phthia the deep-soil'd<br />
<span class="pgnm">221</span><a name="page_221" id="page_221"></a>
On the third day. I have possessions there,<br />
Which hither roaming in an evil hour<br />
I left abundant. I shall also hence<br />
Convey much treasure, gold and burnish'd brass,<span class="lnm">455</span><br />
And glittering steel, and women passing fair<br />
My portion of the spoils. But he, your King,<br />
The prize he gave, himself resumed,<br />
And taunted at me. Tell him my reply,<br />
And tell it him aloud, that other Greeks<span class="lnm">460</span><br />
May indignation feel like me, if arm'd<br />
Always in impudence, he seek to wrong<br />
Them also. Let him not henceforth presume,<br />
Canine and hard in aspect though he be,<br />
To look me in the face. I will not share<span class="lnm">465</span><br />
His counsels, neither will I aid his works.<br />
Let it suffice him, that he wrong'd me once,<br />
Deceived me once, henceforth his glozing arts<br />
Are lost on me. But let him rot in peace<br />
Crazed as he is, and by the stroke of Jove<span class="lnm">470</span><br />
Infatuate. I detest his gifts, and him<br />
So honor as the thing which most I scorn.<br />
And would he give me twenty times the worth<br />
Of this his offer, all the treasured heaps<br />
Which he possesses, or shall yet possess,<span class="lnm">475</span><br />
All that Orchomenos within her walls,<br />
And all that opulent Egyptian Thebes<br />
Receives, the city with a hundred gates,<br />
Whence twenty thousand chariots rush to war,<br />
And would he give me riches as the sands,<span class="lnm">480</span><br />
And as the dust of earth, no gifts from him<br />
Should soothe me, till my soul were first avenged<br />
For all the offensive license of his tongue.<br />
I will not wed the daughter of your Chief,<br />
Of Agamemnon. Could she vie in charms<span class="lnm">485</span><br />
With golden Venus, had she all the skill<br />
Of blue-eyed Pallas, even so endow'd<br />
She were no bride for me. No. He may choose<br />
From the Achaians some superior Prince,<br />
<span class="pgnm">222</span><a name="page_222" id="page_222"></a>
One more her equal. Peleus, if the Gods<span class="lnm">490</span><br />
Preserve me, and I safe arrive at home,<br />
Himself, ere long, shall mate me with a bride.<br />
In Hellas and in Phthia may be found<br />
Fair damsels many, daughters of the Chiefs<br />
Who guard our cities; I may choose of them,<span class="lnm">495</span><br />
And make the loveliest of them all my own.<br />
There, in my country, it hath ever been<br />
My dearest purpose, wedded to a wife<br />
Of rank convenient, to enjoy in peace<br />
Such wealth as ancient Peleus hath acquired.<span class="lnm">500</span><br />
For life, in my account, surpasses far<br />
In value all the treasures which report<br />
Ascribed to populous Ilium, ere the Greeks<br />
Arrived, and while the city yet had peace;<br />
Those also which Apollo's marble shrine<span class="lnm">505</span><br />
In rocky Pytho boasts. Fat flocks and beeves<br />
May be by force obtain'd, tripods and steeds<br />
Are bought or won, but if the breath of man<br />
Once overpass its bounds, no force arrests<br />
Or may constrain the unbodied spirit back.<span class="lnm">510</span><br />
Me, as my silver-footed mother speaks<br />
Thetis, a twofold consummation waits.<br />
If still with battle I encompass Troy,<br />
I win immortal glory, but all hope<br />
Renounce of my return. If I return<span class="lnm">515</span><br />
To my beloved country, I renounce<br />
The illustrious meed of glory, but obtain<br />
Secure and long immunity from death.<br />
And truly I would recommend to all<br />
To voyage homeward, for the fall as yet<span class="lnm">520</span><br />
Ye shall not see of Ilium's lofty towers,<br />
For that the Thunderer with uplifted arm<br />
Protects her, and her courage hath revived.<br />
Bear ye mine answer back, as is the part<br />
Of good ambassadors, that they may frame<span class="lnm">525</span><br />
Some likelier plan, by which both fleet and host<br />
May be preserved; for, my resentment still<br />
<span class="pgnm">223</span><a name="page_223" id="page_223"></a>
Burning, this project is but premature.<br />
Let Ph&oelig;nix stay with us, and sleep this night<br />
Within my tent, that, if he so incline,<span class="lnm">530</span><br />
He may to-morrow in my fleet embark,<br />
And hence attend me; but I leave him free.</p>
<p>  He ended; they astonish'd at his tone<br />
(For vehement he spake) sat silent all,<br />
Till Ph&oelig;nix, aged warrior, at the last<span class="lnm">535</span><br />
Gush'd into tears (for dread his heart o'erwhelm'd<br />
Lest the whole fleet should perish) and replied.</p>
<p>  If thou indeed have purposed to return,<br />
Noble Achilles! and such wrath retain'st<br />
That thou art altogether fixt to leave<span class="lnm">540</span><br />
The fleet a prey to desolating fires,<br />
How then, my son! shall I at Troy abide<br />
Forlorn of thee? When Peleus, hoary Chief,<br />
Sent thee to Agamemnon, yet a child,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_9-13">[13]</a><br />
Unpractised in destructive fight, nor less<span class="lnm">545</span><br />
Of councils ignorant, the schools in which<br />
Great minds are form'd, he bade me to the war<br />
Attend thee forth, that I might teach thee all,<br />
Both elocution and address in arms.<br />
Me therefore shalt thou not with my consent<span class="lnm">550</span><br />
Leave here, my son! no, not would Jove himself<br />
Promise me, reaping smooth this silver beard,<br />
To make me downy-cheek'd as in my youth;<br />
Such as when erst from Hellas beauty-famed<br />
I fled, escaping from my father's wrath<span class="lnm">555</span><br />
Amyntor, son of Ormenus, who loved<br />
A beauteous concubine, and for her sake<br />
Despised his wife and persecuted me.<br />
My mother suppliant at my knees, with prayer<br />
Perpetual importuned me to embrace<span class="lnm">560</span><br />
The damsel first, that she might loathe my sire.<br />
I did so; and my father soon possess'd<br />
<span class="pgnm">224</span><a name="page_224" id="page_224"></a>
With hot suspicion of the fact, let loose<br />
A storm of imprecation, in his rage<br />
Invoking all the Furies to forbid<span class="lnm">565</span><br />
That ever son of mine should press his knees.<br />
Tartarian Jove<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_9-14">[14]</a> and dread Persephone<br />
Fulfill'd his curses; with my pointed spear<br />
I would have pierced his heart, but that my wrath<br />
Some Deity assuaged, suggesting oft<span class="lnm">570</span><br />
What shame and obloquy I should incur,<br />
Known as a parricide through all the land.<br />
At length, so treated, I resolved to dwell<br />
No longer in his house. My friends, indeed,<br />
And all my kindred compass'd me around<span class="lnm">575</span><br />
With much entreaty, wooing me to stay;<br />
Oxen and sheep they slaughter'd, many a plump<br />
Well-fatted brawn extended in the flames,<br />
And drank the old man's vessels to the lees.<br />
Nine nights continual at my side they slept,<span class="lnm">580</span><br />
While others watch'd by turns, nor were the fires<br />
Extinguish'd ever, one, beneath the porch<br />
Of the barr'd hall, and one that from within<br />
The vestibule illumed my chamber door.<br />
But when the tenth dark night at length arrived,<span class="lnm">585</span><br />
Sudden the chamber doors bursting I flew<br />
That moment forth, and unperceived alike<br />
By guards and menial woman, leap'd the wall.<br />
Through spacious Hellas flying thence afar,<br />
I came at length to Phthia the deep-soil'd,<span class="lnm">590</span><br />
Mother of flocks, and to the royal house<br />
Of Peleus; Peleus with a willing heart<br />
Receiving, loved me as a father loves<br />
His only son, the son of his old age,<br />
<span class="pgnm">225</span><a name="page_225" id="page_225"></a>
Inheritor of all his large demesnes.<span class="lnm">595</span><br />
He made me rich; placed under my control<br />
A populous realm, and on the skirts I dwelt<br />
Of Phthia, ruling the Dolopian race.<br />
Thee from my soul, thou semblance of the Gods,<br />
I loved, and all illustrious as thou art,<span class="lnm">600</span><br />
Achilles! such I made thee. For with me,<br />
Me only, would'st thou forth to feast abroad,<br />
Nor would'st thou taste thy food at home, 'till first<br />
I placed thee on my knees, with my own hand<br />
Thy viands carved and fed thee, and the wine<span class="lnm">605</span><br />
Held to thy lips; and many a time, in fits<br />
Of infant frowardness, the purple juice<br />
Rejecting thou hast deluged all my vest,<br />
And fill'd my bosom. Oh, I have endured<br />
Much, and have also much perform'd for thee,<span class="lnm">610</span><br />
Thus purposing, that since the Gods vouchsaf'd<br />
No son to me, thyself shouldst be my son,<br />
Godlike Achilles! who shouldst screen perchance<br />
From a foul fate my else unshelter'd age.<br />
Achilles! bid thy mighty spirit down.<span class="lnm">615</span><br />
Thou shouldst not be thus merciless; the Gods,<br />
Although more honorable, and in power<br />
And virtue thy superiors, are themselves<br />
Yet placable; and if a mortal man<br />
Offend them by transgression of their laws,<span class="lnm">620</span><br />
Libation, incense, sacrifice, and prayer,<br />
In meekness offer'd turn their wrath away.<br />
Prayers are Jove's daughters,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_9-15">[15]</a> wrinkled,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_9-16">[16]</a> lame, slant-eyed,<br />
Which though far distant, yet with constant pace<br />
Follow Offence. Offence, robust of limb,<span class="lnm">625</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">226</span><a name="page_226" id="page_226"></a>
And treading firm the ground, outstrips them all,<br />
And over all the earth before them runs<br />
Hurtful to man. They, following, heal the hurt.<br />
Received respectfully when they approach,<br />
They help us, and our prayers hear in return.<span class="lnm">630</span><br />
But if we slight, and with obdurate heart<br />
Resist them, to Saturnian Jove they cry<br />
Against us, supplicating that Offence<br />
May cleave to us for vengeance of the wrong.<br />
Thou, therefore, O Achilles! honor yield<span class="lnm">635</span><br />
To Jove's own daughters, vanquished, as the brave<br />
Have ofttimes been, by honor paid to thee.<br />
For came not Agamemnon as he comes<br />
With gifts in hand, and promises of more<br />
Hereafter; burn'd his anger still the same,<span class="lnm">640</span><br />
I would not move thee to renounce thy own,<br />
And to assist us, howsoe'er distress'd.<br />
But now, not only are his present gifts<br />
Most liberal, and his promises of more<br />
Such also, but these Princes he hath sent<span class="lnm">645</span><br />
Charged with entreaties, thine especial friends,<br />
And chosen for that cause, from all the host.<br />
Slight not their embassy, nor put to shame<br />
Their intercession. We confess that once<br />
Thy wrath was unreprovable and just.<span class="lnm">650</span><br />
Thus we have heard the heroes of old times<br />
Applauded oft, whose anger, though intense,<br />
Yet left them open to the gentle sway<br />
Of reason and conciliatory gifts.<br />
I recollect an ancient history,<span class="lnm">655</span><br />
Which, since all here are friends, I will relate.<br />
The brave &AElig;tolians and Curetes met<br />
Beneath the walls of Calydon, and fought<br />
With mutual slaughter; the &AElig;tolian powers<br />
In the defence of Calydon the fair,<span class="lnm">660</span><br />
And the Curetes bent to lay it waste:<br />
That strife Diana of the golden throne<br />
Kindled between them, with resentment fired<br />
<span class="pgnm">227</span><a name="page_227" id="page_227"></a>
That Oeneus had not in some fertile spot<br />
The first fruits of his harvest set apart<span class="lnm">665</span><br />
To her; with hecatombs he entertained<br />
All the Divinities of heaven beside,<br />
And her alone, daughter of Jove supreme,<br />
Or through forgetfulness, or some neglect,<br />
Served not; omission careless and profane!<span class="lnm">670</span><br />
She, progeny of Jove, Goddess shaft-arm'd,<br />
A savage boar bright-tusk'd in anger sent,<br />
Which haunting Oeneus' fields much havoc made.<br />
Trees numerous on the earth in heaps he cast<br />
Uprooting them, with all their blossoms on.<span class="lnm">675</span><br />
But Meleager, Oeneus' son, at length<br />
Slew him, the hunters gathering and the hounds<br />
Of numerous cities; for a boar so vast<br />
Might not be vanquish'd by the power of few,<br />
And many to their funeral piles he sent.<span class="lnm">680</span><br />
Then raised Diana clamorous dispute,<br />
And contest hot between them, all alike,<br />
Curetes and &AElig;tolians fierce in arms<br />
The boar's head claiming, and his bristly hide.<br />
So long as warlike Meleager fought,<span class="lnm">685</span><br />
&AElig;tolia prosper'd, nor with all their powers<br />
Could the Curetes stand before the walls.<br />
But when resentment once had fired the heart<br />
Of Meleager, which hath tumult oft<br />
Excited in the breasts of wisest men,<span class="lnm">690</span><br />
(For his own mother had his wrath provoked<br />
Alth&aelig;a) thenceforth with his wedded wife<br />
He dwelt, fair Cleopatra, close retired.<br />
She was Marpessa's daughter, whom she bore<br />
To Idas, bravest warrior in his day<span class="lnm">695</span><br />
Of all on earth. He fear'd not 'gainst the King<br />
Himself Apollo, for the lovely nymph<br />
Marpessa's sake, his spouse, to bend his bow.<br />
Her, therefore, Idas and Marpessa named<br />
Thenceforth Alcyone, because the fate<span class="lnm">700</span><br />
Of sad Alcyone Marpessa shared,<br />
<span class="pgnm">228</span><a name="page_228" id="page_228"></a>
And wept like her, by Ph&oelig;bus forced away.<br />
Thus Meleager, tortured with the pangs<br />
Of wrath indulged, with Cleopatra dwelt,<br />
Vex'd that his mother cursed him; for, with grief<span class="lnm">705</span><br />
Frantic, his mother importuned the Gods<br />
To avenge her slaughter'd brothers<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_9-17">[17]</a> on his head.<br />
Oft would she smite the earth, while on her knees<br />
Seated, she fill'd her bosom with her tears,<br />
And call'd on Pluto and dread Proserpine<span class="lnm">710</span><br />
To slay her son; nor vain was that request,<br />
But by implacable Erynnis heard<br />
Roaming the shades of Erebus. Ere long<br />
The tumult and the deafening din of war<br />
Roar'd at the gates, and all the batter'd towers<span class="lnm">715</span><br />
Resounded. Then the elders of the town<br />
Dispatch'd the high-priests of the Gods to plead<br />
With Meleager for his instant aid,<br />
With strong assurances of rich reward.<br />
Where Calydon afforded fattest soil<span class="lnm">720</span><br />
They bade him choose to his own use a farm<br />
Of fifty measured acres, vineyard half,<br />
And half of land commodious for the plow.<br />
Him Oeneus also, warrior grey with age,<br />
Ascending to his chamber, and his doors<span class="lnm">725</span><br />
Smiting importunate, with earnest prayers<br />
Assay'd to soften, kneeling to his son.<br />
Nor less his sisters woo'd him to relent,<br />
Nor less his mother; but in vain; he grew<br />
Still more obdurate. His companions last,<span class="lnm">730</span><br />
The most esteem'd and dearest of his friends,<br />
The same suit urged, yet he persisted still<br />
Relentless, nor could even they prevail.<br />
But when the battle shook his chamber-doors<br />
And the Curetes climbing the high towers<span class="lnm">735</span><br />
Had fired the spacious city, then with tears<br />
The beauteous Cleopatra, and with prayers<br />
<span class="pgnm">229</span><a name="page_229" id="page_229"></a>
Assail'd him; in his view she set the woes<br />
Numberless of a city storm'd&mdash;the men<br />
Slaughter'd, the city burnt to dust, the chaste<span class="lnm">740</span><br />
Matrons with all their children dragg'd away.<br />
That dread recital roused him, and at length<br />
Issuing, he put his radiant armor on.<br />
Thus Meleager, gratifying first<br />
His own resentment from a fatal day<span class="lnm">745</span><br />
Saved the &AElig;tolians, who the promised gift<br />
Refused him, and his toils found no reward.<br />
But thou, my son, be wiser; follow thou<br />
No demon who would tempt thee to a course<br />
Like his; occasion more propitious far<span class="lnm">750</span><br />
Smiles on thee now, than if the fleet were fired.<br />
Come, while by gifts invited, and receive<br />
From all the host, the honors of a God;<br />
For shouldst thou, by no gifts induced, at last<br />
Enter the bloody field, although thou chase<span class="lnm">755</span><br />
The Trojans hence, yet less shall be thy praise.</p>
<p>  Then thus Achilles, matchless in the race.<br />
Ph&oelig;nix, my guide, wise, noble and revered!<br />
I covet no such glory! the renown<br />
Ordain'd by Jove for me, is to resist<span class="lnm">760</span><br />
All importunity to quit my ships<br />
While I have power to move, or breath to draw.<br />
Hear now, and mark me well. Cease thou from tears.<br />
Confound me not, pleading with sighs and sobs<br />
In Agamemnon's cause; O love not him,<span class="lnm">765</span><br />
Lest I renounce thee, who am now thy friend.<br />
Assist me rather, as thy duty bids,<br />
Him to afflict, who hath afflicted me,<br />
So shalt thou share my glory and my power.<br />
These shall report as they have heard, but here<span class="lnm">770</span><br />
Rest thou this night, and with the rising morn<br />
We will decide, to stay or to depart.</p>
<p>  He ceased, and silent, by a nod enjoin'd<br />
Patroclus to prepare an easy couch<br />
For Ph&oelig;nix, anxious to dismiss the rest<span class="lnm">775</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">230</span><a name="page_230" id="page_230"></a>
Incontinent; when Ajax, godlike son<br />
Of Telamon, arising, thus began.</p>
<p>  Laertes' noble son, for wiles renown'd:<br />
Depart we now; for I perceive that end<br />
Or fruit of all our reasonings shall be none.<span class="lnm">780</span><br />
It is expedient also that we bear<br />
Our answer back (unwelcome as it is)<br />
With all dispatch, for the assembled Greeks<br />
Expect us. Brave Achilles shuts a fire<br />
Within his breast; the kindness of his friends,<span class="lnm">785</span><br />
And the respect peculiar by ourselves<br />
Shown to him, on his heart work no effect.<br />
Inexorable man! others accept<br />
Even for a brother slain, or for a son<br />
Due compensation;<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_9-18">[18]</a> the delinquent dwells<span class="lnm">790</span><br />
Secure at home, and the receiver, soothed<br />
And pacified, represses his revenge.<br />
But thou, resentful of the loss of one,<br />
One virgin (such obduracy of heart<br />
The Gods have given thee) can'st not be appeased<span class="lnm">795</span><br />
Yet we assign thee seven in her stead,<br />
The most distinguish'd of their sex, and add<br />
Large gifts beside. Ah then, at last relent!<br />
Respect thy roof; we are thy guests; we come<br />
Chosen from the multitude of all the Greeks,<span class="lnm">800</span><br />
Beyond them all ambitious of thy love.</p>
<p>  To whom Achilles, swiftest of the swift.<br />
My noble friend, offspring of Telamon!<br />
Thou seem'st sincere, and I believe thee such.<br />
But at the very mention of the name<span class="lnm">805</span><br />
Of Atreus' son, who shamed me in the sight<br />
Of all Achaia's host, bearing me down<br />
As I had been some vagrant at his door,<br />
<span class="pgnm">231</span><a name="page_231" id="page_231"></a>
My bosom boils. Return ye and report<br />
Your answer. I no thought will entertain<span class="lnm">810</span><br />
Of crimson war, till the illustrious son<br />
Of warlike Priam, Hector, blood-embrued,<br />
Shall in their tents the Myrmidons assail<br />
Themselves, and fire my fleet. At my own ship,<br />
And at my own pavilion it may chance<span class="lnm">815</span><br />
That even Hector's violence shall pause.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_9-19">[19]</a></p>
<p>  He ended; they from massy goblets each<br />
Libation pour'd, and to the fleet their course<br />
Resumed direct, Ulysses at their head.<br />
Patroclus then his fellow-warriors bade,<span class="lnm">820</span><br />
And the attendant women spread a couch<br />
For Ph&oelig;nix; they the couch, obedient, spread<br />
With fleeces, with rich arras, and with flax<br />
Of subtlest woof. There hoary Ph&oelig;nix lay<br />
In expectation of the sacred dawn.<span class="lnm">825</span><br />
Meantime Achilles in the interior tent,<br />
With beauteous Diomeda by himself<br />
From Lesbos brought, daughter of Phorbas, lay.<br />
Patroclus opposite reposed, with whom<br />
Slept charming Iphis; her, when he had won<span class="lnm">830</span><br />
The lofty towers of Scyros, the divine<br />
Achilles took, and on his friend bestow'd.</p>
<p>  But when those Chiefs at Agamemnon's tent<br />
Arrived, the Greeks on every side arose<br />
With golden cups welcoming their return.<span class="lnm">835</span><br />
All question'd them, but Agamemnon first.</p>
<p>  Oh worthy of Achaia's highest praise,<br />
And her chief ornament, Ulysses, speak!<br />
Will he defend the fleet? or his big heart<br />
Indulging wrathful, doth he still refuse?<span class="lnm">840</span></p>
<p>  To whom renown'd Ulysses thus replied.<br />
Atrides, Agamemnon, King of men!<br />
<span class="pgnm">232</span><a name="page_232" id="page_232"></a>
He his resentment quenches not, nor will,<br />
But burns with wrath the more, thee and thy gifts<br />
Rejecting both. He bids thee with the Greeks<span class="lnm">845</span><br />
Consult by what expedient thou may'st save<br />
The fleet and people, threatening that himself<br />
Will at the peep of day launch all his barks,<br />
And counselling, beside, the general host<br />
To voyage homeward, for that end as yet<span class="lnm">850</span><br />
Of Ilium wall'd to heaven, ye shall not find,<br />
Since Jove the Thunderer with uplifted arm<br />
Protects her, and her courage hath revived.<br />
Thus speaks the Chief, and Ajax is prepared,<br />
With the attendant heralds to report<span class="lnm">855</span><br />
As I have said. But Ph&oelig;nix in the tent<br />
Sleeps of Achilles, who his stay desired,<br />
That on the morrow, if he so incline,<br />
The hoary warrior may attend him hence<br />
Home to his country, but he leaves him free.<span class="lnm">860</span></p>
<p>  He ended. They astonish'd at his tone<br />
(For vehement he spake) sat silent all.<br />
Long silent sat the afflicted sons of Greece,<br />
When thus the mighty Diomede began.</p>
<p>  Atrides, Agamemnon, King of men!<span class="lnm">865</span><br />
Thy supplications to the valiant son<br />
Of Peleus, and the offer of thy gifts<br />
Innumerous, had been better far withheld.<br />
He is at all times haughty, and thy suit<br />
Hath but increased his haughtiness of heart<span class="lnm">870</span><br />
Past bounds: but let him stay or let him go<br />
As he shall choose. He will resume the fight<br />
When his own mind shall prompt him, and the Gods<br />
Shall urge him forth. Now follow my advice.<br />
Ye have refresh'd your hearts with food and wine<span class="lnm">875</span><br />
Which are the strength of man; take now repose.<br />
And when the rosy-finger'd morning fair<br />
Shall shine again, set forth without delay<br />
The battle, horse and foot, before the fleet,<br />
And where the foremost fight, fight also thou.<span class="lnm">880</span></p>
<p><span class="pgnm">233</span><a name="page_233" id="page_233"></a>
  He ended; all the Kings applauded warm<br />
His counsel, and the dauntless tone admired<br />
Of Diomede. Then, due libation made,<br />
Each sought his tent, and took the gift of sleep.</p>

<p class="noind">All night the leaders of the host of Greece<br />
Lay sunk in soft repose, all, save the Chief,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_10-1">[1]</a><br />
The son of Atreus; him from thought to thought<br />
Roving solicitous, no sleep relieved.<br />
As when the spouse of beauteous Juno, darts<span class="lnm">5</span><br />
His frequent fires, designing heavy rain<br />
Immense, or hail-storm, or field-whitening snow,<br />
Or else wide-throated war calamitous,<br />
So frequent were the groans by Atreus' son<br />
Heaved from his inmost heart, trembling with dread.<span class="lnm">10</span><br />
For cast he but his eye toward the plain<br />
Of Ilium, there, astonish'd he beheld<br />
The city fronted with bright fires, and heard<br />
Pipes, and recorders, and the hum of war;<br />
But when again the Grecian fleet he view'd,<span class="lnm">15</span><br />
And thought on his own people, then his hair<br />
Uprooted elevating to the Gods,<br />
He from his generous bosom groan'd again.<br />
At length he thus resolved; of all the Greeks<br />
To seek Neleian Nestor first, with whom<span class="lnm">20</span><br />
He might, perchance, some plan for the defence<br />
Of the afflicted Dana&iuml; devise.<br />
Rising, he wrapp'd his tunic to his breast,<br />
<span class="pgnm">238</span><a name="page_238" id="page_238"></a>
And to his royal feet unsullied bound<br />
His sandals; o'er his shoulders, next, he threw<span class="lnm">25</span><br />
Of amplest size a lion's tawny skin<br />
That swept his footsteps, dappled o'er with blood,<br />
Then took his spear. Meantime, not less appall'd<br />
Was Menelaus, on whose eyelids sleep<br />
Sat not, lest the Achaians for his sake<span class="lnm">30</span><br />
O'er many waters borne, and now intent<br />
On glorious deeds, should perish all at Troy.<br />
With a pard's spotted hide his shoulders broad<br />
He mantled over; to his head he raised<br />
His brazen helmet, and with vigorous hand<span class="lnm">35</span><br />
Grasping his spear, forth issued to arouse<br />
His brother, mighty sovereign of the host,<br />
And by the Grecians like a God revered.<br />
He found him at his galley's stern, his arms<br />
Assuming radiant; welcome he arrived<span class="lnm">40</span><br />
To Agamemnon, whom he thus address'd.</p>
<p>  Why arm'st thou, brother? Wouldst thou urge abroad<br />
Some trusty spy into the Trojan camp?<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_10-2">[2]</a><br />
I fear lest none so hardy shall be found<br />
As to adventure, in the dead still night,<span class="lnm">45</span><br />
So far, alone; valiant indeed were he!</p>
<p>  To whom great Agamemnon thus replied.<br />
Heaven-favor'd Menelaus! We have need,<br />
Thou and myself, of some device well-framed,<br />
Which both the Grecians and the fleet of Greece<span class="lnm">50</span><br />
May rescue, for the mind of Jove hath changed,<br />
And Hector's prayers alone now reach his ear.<br />
I never saw, nor by report have learn'd<br />
From any man, that ever single chief<br />
Such awful wonders in one day perform'd<span class="lnm">55</span><br />
As he with ease against the Greeks, although<br />
Nor from a Goddess sprung nor from a God.<br />
<span class="pgnm">239</span><a name="page_239" id="page_239"></a>
Deeds he hath done, which, as I think, the Greeks<br />
Shall deep and long lament, such numerous ills<br />
Achaia's host hath at his hands sustain'd.<span class="lnm">60</span><br />
But haste, begone, and at their several ships<br />
Call Ajax and Idomeneus; I go<br />
To exhort the noble Nestor to arise,<br />
That he may visit, if he so incline,<br />
The chosen band who watch, and his advice<span class="lnm">65</span><br />
Give them; for him most prompt they will obey,<br />
Whose son, together with Meriones,<br />
Friend of Idomeneus, controls them all,<br />
Entrusted by ourselves with that command.</p>
<p>  Him answer'd Menelaus bold in arms.<span class="lnm">70</span><br />
Explain thy purpose. Wouldst thou that I wait<br />
Thy coming, there, or thy commands to both<br />
Given, that I incontinent return?</p>
<p>  To whom the Sovereign of the host replied.<br />
There stay; lest striking into different paths<span class="lnm">75</span><br />
(For many passes intersect the camp)<br />
We miss each other; summon them aloud<br />
Where thou shalt come; enjoin them to arise;<br />
Call each by his hereditary name,<br />
Honoring all. Beware of manners proud,<span class="lnm">80</span><br />
For we ourselves must labor, at our birth<br />
By Jove ordain'd to suffering and to toil.</p>
<p>  So saying, he his brother thence dismiss'd<br />
Instructed duly, and himself, his steps<br />
Turned to the tent of Nestor. Him he found<span class="lnm">85</span><br />
Amid his sable galleys in his tent<br />
Reposing soft, his armor at his side,<br />
Shield, spears, bright helmet, and the broider'd belt<br />
Which, when the Senior arm'd led forth his host<br />
To fight, he wore; for he complied not yet<span class="lnm">90</span><br />
With the encroachments of enfeebling age.<br />
He raised his head, and on his elbow propp'd,<br />
Questioning Agamemnon, thus began.</p>
<p>  But who art thou, who thus alone, the camp<br />
Roamest, amid the darkness of the night,<span class="lnm">95</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">240</span><a name="page_240" id="page_240"></a>
While other mortals sleep? Comest thou abroad<br />
Seeking some friend or soldier of the guard?<br />
Speak&mdash;come not nearer mute. What is thy wish?</p>
<p>  To whom the son of Atreus, King of men.<br />
Oh Nestor, glory of the Grecian name,<span class="lnm">100</span><br />
Offspring of Neleus! thou in me shalt know<br />
The son of Atreus, Agamemnon, doom'd<br />
By Jove to toil, while life shall yet inform<br />
These limbs, or I shall draw the vital air.<br />
I wander thus, because that on my lids<span class="lnm">105</span><br />
Sweet sleep sits not, but war and the concerns<br />
Of the Achaians occupy my soul.<br />
Terrible are the fears which I endure<br />
For these my people; such as supersede<br />
All thought; my bosom can no longer hold<span class="lnm">110</span><br />
My throbbing heart, and tremors shake my limbs.<br />
But if thy mind, more capable, project<br />
Aught that may profit us (for thee it seems<br />
Sleep also shuns) arise, and let us both<br />
Visit the watch, lest, haply, overtoil'd<span class="lnm">115</span><br />
They yield to sleep, forgetful of their charge.<br />
The foe is posted near, and may intend<br />
(None knows his purpose) an assault by night.</p>
<p>  To him Gerenian Nestor thus replied.<br />
Illustrious Agamemnon, King of men!<span class="lnm">120</span><br />
Deep-planning Jove the imaginations proud<br />
Of Hector will not ratify, nor all<br />
His sanguine hopes effectuate; in his turn<br />
He also (fierce Achilles once appeased)<br />
Shall trouble feel, and haply, more than we.<span class="lnm">125</span><br />
But with all readiness I will arise<br />
And follow thee, that we may also rouse<br />
Yet others; Diomede the spear-renown'd,<br />
Ulysses, the swift Ajax, and the son<br />
Of Phyleus, valiant Meges. It were well<span class="lnm">130</span><br />
Were others also visited and call'd,<br />
The godlike Ajax, and Idomeneus,<br />
Whose ships are at the camp's extremest bounds.<br />
<span class="pgnm">241</span><a name="page_241" id="page_241"></a>
But though I love thy brother and revere,<br />
And though I grieve e'en thee, yet speak I must,<span class="lnm">135</span><br />
And plainly censure him, that thus he sleeps<br />
And leaves to thee the labor, who himself<br />
Should range the host, soliciting the Chiefs<br />
Of every band, as utmost need requires.</p>
<p>  Him answer'd Agamemnon, King of men.<span class="lnm">140</span><br />
Old warrior, times there are, when I could wish<br />
Myself thy censure of him, for in act<br />
He is not seldom tardy and remiss.<br />
Yet is not sluggish indolence the cause,<br />
No, nor stupidity, but he observes<span class="lnm">145</span><br />
Me much, expecting till I lead the way.<br />
But he was foremost now, far more alert<br />
This night than I, and I have sent him forth<br />
Already, those to call whom thou hast named.<br />
But let us hence, for at the guard I trust<span class="lnm">150</span><br />
To find them, since I gave them so in charge.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_10-3">[3]</a></p>
<p>  To whom the brave Gerenian Chief replied.<br />
Him none will censure, or his will dispute,<br />
Whom he shall waken and exhort to rise.</p>
<p>  So saying, he bound his corselet to his breast,<span class="lnm">155</span><br />
His sandals fair to his unsullied feet,<br />
And fastening by its clasps his purple cloak<br />
Around him, double and of shaggy pile,<br />
Seized, next, his sturdy spear headed with brass,<br />
And issued first into the Grecian fleet.<span class="lnm">160</span><br />
There, Nestor, brave Gerenian, with a voice<br />
Sonorous roused the godlike counsellor<br />
From sleep, Ulysses; the alarm came o'er<br />
His startled ear, forth from his tent he sprang<br />
Sudden, and of their coming, quick, inquired.<span class="lnm">165</span></p>
<p>  Why roam ye thus the camp and fleet alone<br />
In darkness? by what urgent need constrain'd?</p>
<p>  To whom the hoary Pylian thus replied.<br />
Laertes' noble son, for wiles renown'd!<br />
<span class="pgnm">242</span><a name="page_242" id="page_242"></a>
Resent it not, for dread is our distress.<span class="lnm">170</span><br />
Come, therefore, and assist us to convene<br />
Yet others, qualified to judge if war<br />
Be most expedient, or immediate flight.</p>
<p>  He ended, and regaining, quick, his tent,<br />
Ulysses slung his shield, then coming forth<span class="lnm">175</span><br />
Join'd them. The son of Tydeus first they sought.<br />
Him sleeping arm'd before his tent they found,<br />
Encompass'd by his friends also asleep;<br />
His head each rested on his shield, and each<br />
Had planted on its nether point<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_10-4">[4]</a> erect<span class="lnm">180</span><br />
His spear beside him; bright their polish'd heads,<br />
As Jove's own lightning glittered from afar.<br />
Himself, the Hero, slept. A wild bull's hide<br />
Was spread beneath him, and on arras tinged<br />
With splendid purple lay his head reclined.<span class="lnm">185</span><br />
Nestor, beside him standing, with his heel<br />
Shook him, and, urgent, thus the Chief reproved.</p>
<p>  Awake, Tydides! wherefore givest the night<br />
Entire to balmy slumber? Hast not heard<br />
How on the rising ground beside the fleet<span class="lnm">190</span><br />
The Trojans sit, small interval between?</p>
<p>  He ceased; then up sprang Diomede alarm'd<br />
Instant, and in wing'd accents thus replied.</p>
<p>  Old wakeful Chief! thy toils are never done.<br />
Are there not younger of the sons of Greece,<span class="lnm">195</span><br />
Who ranging in all parts the camp, might call<br />
The Kings to council? But no curb controls<br />
Or can abate activity like thine.</p>
<p>  To whom Gerenian Nestor in return.<br />
My friend! thou hast well spoken. I have sons,<span class="lnm">200</span><br />
And they are well deserving; I have here<br />
A numerous people also, one of whom<br />
Might have sufficed to call the Kings of Greece.<br />
But such occasion presses now the host<br />
<span class="pgnm">243</span><a name="page_243" id="page_243"></a>
As hath not oft occurr'd; the overthrow<span class="lnm">205</span><br />
Complete, or full deliverance of us all,<br />
In balance hangs, poised on a razor's edge.<br />
But haste, and if thy pity of my toils<br />
Be such, since thou art younger, call, thyself,<br />
Ajax the swift, and Meges to the guard.<span class="lnm">210</span></p>
<p>  Then Diomede a lion's tawny skin<br />
Around him wrapp'd, dependent to his heels,<br />
And, spear in hand, set forth. The Hero call'd<br />
Those two, and led them whither Nestor bade.</p>
<p>  They, at the guard arrived, not sleeping found<span class="lnm">215</span><br />
The captains of the guard, but sitting all<br />
In vigilant posture with their arms prepared.<br />
As dogs that, careful, watch the fold by night,<br />
Hearing some wild beast in the woods,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_10-5">[5]</a> which hounds<br />
And hunters with tumultuous clamor drive<span class="lnm">220</span><br />
Down from the mountain-top, all sleep forego;<br />
So, sat not on their eyelids gentle sleep<br />
That dreadful night, but constant to the plain<br />
At every sound of Trojan feet they turn'd.<br />
The old Chief joyful at the sight, in terms<span class="lnm">225</span><br />
Of kind encouragement them thus address'd.</p>
<p>  So watch, my children! and beware that sleep<br />
Invade none here, lest all become a prey.</p>
<p>  So saying, he traversed with quick pace the trench<br />
By every Chief whom they had thither call'd<span class="lnm">230</span><br />
Attended, with whom Nestor's noble son<br />
Went, and Meriones, invited both<br />
To join their consultation. From the foss<br />
Emerging, in a vacant space they sat,<br />
Unstrew'd with bodies of the slain, the spot,<span class="lnm">235</span><br />
Whence furious Hector, after slaughter made<br />
Of numerous Greeks, night falling, had return'd.<br />
There seated, mutual converse close they held,<br />
And Nestor, brave Gerenian, thus began.</p>
<p><span class="pgnm">244</span><a name="page_244" id="page_244"></a>
  Oh friends! hath no Achaian here such trust<span class="lnm">240</span><br />
In his own prowess, as to venture forth<br />
Among yon haughty Trojans? He, perchance,<br />
Might on the borders of their host surprise<br />
Some wandering adversary, or might learn<br />
Their consultations, whether they propose<span class="lnm">245</span><br />
Here to abide in prospect of the fleet,<br />
Or, satiate with success against the Greeks<br />
So signal, meditate retreat to Troy.<br />
These tidings gain'd, should he at last return<br />
Secure, his recompense will be renown<span class="lnm">250</span><br />
Extensive as the heavens, and fair reward.<br />
From every leader of the fleet, his gift<br />
Shall be a sable<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_10-6">[6]</a> ewe, and sucking lamb,<br />
Rare acquisition! and at every board<br />
And sumptuous banquet, he shall be a guest.<span class="lnm">255</span></p>
<p>  He ceased, and all sat silent, when at length<br />
The mighty son of Tydeus thus replied.</p>
<p>  Me, Nestor, my courageous heart incites<br />
To penetrate into the neighbor host<br />
Of enemies; but went some other Chief<span class="lnm">260</span><br />
With me, far greater would my comfort prove,<br />
And I should dare the more. Two going forth,<br />
One quicker sees than other, and suggests<br />
Prudent advice; but he who single goes,<br />
Mark whatsoe'er he may, the occasion less<span class="lnm">265</span><br />
Improves, and his expedients soon exhausts.</p>
<p>  He ended, and no few willing arose<br />
To go with Diomede. Servants of Mars<br />
Each Ajax willing stood; willing as they<br />
Meriones; most willing Nestor's son;<span class="lnm">270</span><br />
Willing the brother of the Chief of all,<br />
Nor willing less Ulysses to explore<br />
The host of Troy, for he possess'd a heart<br />
Delighted ever with some bold exploit.</p>
<p>  Then Agamemnon, King of men, began.<span class="lnm">275</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">245</span><a name="page_245" id="page_245"></a>
Now Diomede, in whom my soul delights!<br />
Choose whom thou wilt for thy companion; choose<br />
The fittest here; for numerous wish to go.<br />
Leave not through deference to another's rank,<br />
The more deserving, nor prefer a worse,<span class="lnm">280</span><br />
Respecting either pedigree or power.</p>
<p>  Such speech he interposed, fearing his choice<br />
Of Menelaus; then, renown'd in arms<br />
The son of Tydeus, rising, spake again.</p>
<p>  Since, then, ye bid me my own partner choose<span class="lnm">285</span><br />
Free from constraint, how can I overlook<br />
Divine Ulysses, whose courageous heart<br />
With such peculiar cheerfulness endures<br />
Whatever toils, and whom Minerva loves?<br />
Let <i>him</i> attend me, and through fire itself<span class="lnm">290</span><br />
We shall return; for none is wise as he.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_10-7">[7]</a></p>
<p>  To him Ulysses, hardy Chief, replied.<br />
Tydides! neither praise me much, nor blame,<br />
For these are Grecians in whose ears thou speak'st,<br />
And know me well. But let us hence! the night<span class="lnm">295</span><br />
Draws to a close; day comes apace; the stars<br />
Are far advanced; two portions have elapsed<br />
Of darkness, but the third is yet entire.</p>
<p>  So they; then each his dreadful arms put on.<br />
To Diomede, who at the fleet had left<span class="lnm">300</span><br />
His own, the dauntless Thrasymedes gave<br />
His shield and sword two-edged, and on his head<br />
Placed, crestless, unadorn'd, his bull-skin casque.<br />
It was a stripling's helmet, such as youths<br />
Scarce yet confirm'd in lusty manhood, wear.<span class="lnm">305</span><br />
Meriones with quiver, bow and sword<br />
Furnish'd Ulysses, and his brows enclosed<br />
In his own casque of hide with many a thong<br />
<span class="pgnm">246</span><a name="page_246" id="page_246"></a>
Well braced within;<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_10-8">[8]</a> guarded it was without<br />
With boar's teeth ivory-white inherent firm<span class="lnm">310</span><br />
On all sides, and with woolen head-piece lined.<br />
That helmet erst Autolycus<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_10-9">[9]</a> had brought<br />
From Eleon, city of Amyntor son<br />
Of Hormenus, where he the solid walls<br />
Bored through, clandestine, of Amyntor's house.<span class="lnm">315</span><br />
He on Amphidamas the prize bestow'd<br />
In Scandia;<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_10-10">[10]</a> from Amphidamas it pass'd<br />
To Molus as a hospitable pledge;<br />
He gave it to Meriones his son,<br />
And now it guarded shrewd Ulysses' brows.<span class="lnm">320</span><br />
Both clad in arms terrific, forth they sped,<br />
Leaving their fellow Chiefs, and as they went<br />
A heron, by command of Pallas, flew<br />
Close on the right beside them; darkling they<br />
Discern'd him not, but heard his clanging plumes.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_10-11">[11]</a><span class="lnm">325</span><br />
Ulysses in the favorable sign<br />
Exulted, and Minerva thus invoked.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_10-12">[12]</a></p>
<p><span class="pgnm">247</span><a name="page_247" id="page_247"></a>
  Oh hear me, daughter of Jove &AElig;gis-arm'd!<br />
My present helper in all straits, whose eye<br />
Marks all my ways, oh with peculiar care<span class="lnm">330</span><br />
Now guard me, Pallas! grant that after toil<br />
Successful, glorious, such as long shall fill<br />
With grief the Trojans, we may safe return<br />
And with immortal honors to the fleet.</p>
<p>  Valiant Tydides, next, his prayer preferr'd.<span class="lnm">335</span><br />
Hear also me, Jove's offspring by the toils<br />
Of war invincible! me follow now<br />
As my heroic father erst to Thebes<br />
Thou followedst, Tydeus; by the Greeks dispatch'd<br />
Ambassador, he left the mail-clad host<span class="lnm">340</span><br />
Beside Asopus, and with terms of peace<br />
Entrusted, enter'd Thebes; but by thine aid<br />
Benevolent, and in thy strength, perform'd<br />
Returning, deeds of terrible renown.<br />
Thus, now, protect me also! In return<span class="lnm">345</span><br />
I vow an offering at thy shrine, a young<br />
Broad-fronted heifer, to the yoke as yet<br />
Untamed, whose horns I will incase with gold.</p>
<p>  Such prayer they made, and Pallas heard well pleased.<br />
Their orisons ended to the daughter dread<span class="lnm">350</span><br />
Of mighty Jove, lion-like they advanced<br />
Through shades of night, through carnage, arms and blood.</p>
<p>  Nor Hector to his gallant host indulged<br />
Sleep, but convened the leaders; leader none<br />
Or senator of all his host he left<span class="lnm">355</span><br />
Unsummon'd, and his purpose thus promulged.</p>
<p>  Where is the warrior who for rich reward,<br />
Such as shall well suffice him, will the task<br />
Adventurous, which I propose, perform?<br />
A chariot with two steeds of proudest height,<span class="lnm">360</span><br />
Surpassing all in the whole fleet of Greece<br />
Shall be his portion, with immortal praise,<br />
Who shall the well-appointed ships approach<br />
Courageous, there to learn if yet a guard<br />
<span class="pgnm">248</span><a name="page_248" id="page_248"></a>
As heretofore, keep them, or if subdued<span class="lnm">365</span><br />
Beneath us, the Achaians flight intend,<br />
And worn with labor have no will to watch.</p>
<p>  So Hector spake, but answer none return'd.<br />
There was a certain Trojan, Dolon named,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_10-13">[13]</a><br />
Son of Eumedes herald of the Gods,<span class="lnm">370</span><br />
Rich both in gold and brass, but in his form<br />
Unsightly; yet the man was swift of foot,<br />
Sole brother of five sisters; he his speech<br />
To Hector and the Trojans thus address'd.</p>
<p>  My spirit, Hector, prompts me, and my mind<span class="lnm">375</span><br />
Endued with manly vigor, to approach<br />
Yon gallant ships, that I may tidings hear.<br />
But come. For my assurance, lifting high<br />
Thy sceptre, swear to me, for my reward,<br />
The horses and the brazen chariot bright<span class="lnm">380</span><br />
Which bear renown'd Achilles o'er the field.<br />
I will not prove a useless spy, nor fall<br />
Below thy best opinion; pass I will<br />
Their army through, 'till I shall reach the ship<br />
Of Agamemnon, where the Chiefs, perchance,<span class="lnm">385</span><br />
Now sit consulting, or to fight, or fly.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_10-14">[14]</a></p>
<p><span class="pgnm">249</span><a name="page_249" id="page_249"></a>
  Then raising high his sceptre, Hector sware<br />
Know, Jove himself, Juno's high-thundering spouse!<br />
That Trojan none shall in that chariot ride<br />
By those steeds drawn, save Dolon; on my oath<span class="lnm">390</span><br />
I make them thine; enjoy them evermore.</p>
<p>  He said, and falsely sware, yet him assured.<br />
Then Dolon, instant, o'er his shoulder slung<br />
His bow elastic, wrapp'd himself around<br />
With a grey wolf-skin, to his head a casque<span class="lnm">395</span><br />
Adjusted, coated o'er with ferret's felt,<br />
And seizing his sharp javelin, from the host<br />
Turn'd right toward the fleet, but was ordain'd<br />
To disappoint his sender, and to bring<br />
No tidings thence. The throng of Trojan steeds<span class="lnm">400</span><br />
And warriors left, with brisker pace he moved,<br />
When brave Ulysses his approach perceived,<br />
And thus to Diomede his speech address'd.</p>
<p>  Tydides! yonder man is from the host;<br />
Either a spy he comes, or with intent<span class="lnm">405</span><br />
To spoil the dead. First, freely let him pass<br />
Few paces, then pursuing him with speed,<br />
Seize on him suddenly; but should he prove<br />
The nimbler of the three, with threatening spear<br />
Enforce him from his camp toward the fleet,<span class="lnm">410</span><br />
Lest he elude us, and escape to Troy.</p>
<p>  So they; then, turning from the road oblique,<br />
Among the carcases each laid him down.<br />
Dolon, suspecting nought, ran swiftly by.<br />
<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_10-15">[15]</a>But when such space was interposed as mules<span class="lnm">415</span><br />
Plow in a day (for mules the ox surpass<br />
Through fallows deep drawing the ponderous plow)<br />
Both ran toward him. Dolon at the sound<br />
Stood; for he hoped some Trojan friends at hand<br />
From Hector sent to bid him back again.<span class="lnm">420</span><br />
But when within spear's cast, or less they came,<br />
<span class="pgnm">250</span><a name="page_250" id="page_250"></a>
Knowing them enemies he turn'd to flight<br />
Incontinent, whom they as swift pursued.<br />
As two fleet hounds sharp fang'd, train'd to the chase,<br />
Hang on the rear of flying hind or hare,<span class="lnm">425</span><br />
And drive her, never swerving from the track,<br />
Through copses close; she screaming scuds before;<br />
So Diomede and dread Ulysses him<br />
Chased constant, intercepting his return.<br />
And now, fast-fleeting to the ships, he soon<span class="lnm">430</span><br />
Had reach'd the guard, but Pallas with new force<br />
Inspired Tydides, lest a meaner Greek<br />
Should boast that he had smitten Dolon first,<br />
And Diomede win only second praise.<br />
He poised his lifted spear, and thus exclaim'd.<span class="lnm">435</span></p>
<p>  Stand! or my spear shall stop thee. Death impends<br />
At every step; thou canst not 'scape me long.</p>
<p>  He said, and threw his spear, but by design,<br />
Err'd from the man. The polish'd weapon swift<br />
O'er-glancing his right shoulder, in the soil<span class="lnm">440</span><br />
Stood fixt, beyond him. Terrified he stood,<br />
Stammering, and sounding through his lips the clash<br />
Of chattering teeth, with visage deadly wan.<br />
They panting rush'd on him, and both his hands<br />
Seized fast; he wept, and suppliant them bespake.<span class="lnm">445</span></p>
<p>  Take me alive, and I will pay the price<br />
Of my redemption. I have gold at home,<br />
Brass also, and bright steel, and when report<br />
Of my captivity within your fleet<br />
Shall reach my father, treasures he will give<span class="lnm">450</span><br />
Not to be told, for ransom of his son.</p>
<p>  To whom Ulysses politic replied.<br />
Take courage; entertain no thought of death.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_10-16">[16]</a><br />
But haste! this tell me, and disclose the truth.<br />
Why thus toward the ships comest thou alone<span class="lnm">455</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">251</span><a name="page_251" id="page_251"></a>
From yonder host, by night, while others sleep?<br />
To spoil some carcase? or from Hector sent<br />
A spy of all that passes in the fleet?<br />
Or by thy curiosity impell'd?</p>
<p>  Then Dolon, his limbs trembling, thus replied.<span class="lnm">460</span><br />
To my great detriment, and far beyond<br />
My own design, Hector trepann'd me forth,<br />
Who promised me the steeds of Peleus' son<br />
Illustrious, and his brazen chariot bright.<br />
He bade me, under night's fast-flitting shades<span class="lnm">465</span><br />
Approach our enemies, a spy, to learn<br />
If still as heretofore, ye station guards<br />
For safety of your fleet, or if subdued<br />
Completely, ye intend immediate flight,<br />
And worn with labor, have no will to watch.<span class="lnm">470</span></p>
<p>  To whom Ulysses, smiling, thus replied.<br />
Thou hadst, in truth, an appetite to gifts<br />
Of no mean value, coveting the steeds<br />
Of brave &AElig;acides; but steeds are they<br />
Of fiery sort, difficult to be ruled<span class="lnm">475</span><br />
By force of mortal man, Achilles' self<br />
Except, whom an immortal mother bore.<br />
But tell me yet again; use no disguise;<br />
Where left'st thou, at thy coming forth, your Chief,<br />
The valiant Hector? where hath he disposed<span class="lnm">480</span><br />
His armor battle-worn, and where his steeds?<br />
What other quar4ers of your host are watch'd?<br />
Where lodge the guard, and what intend ye next?<br />
Still to abide in prospect of the fleet?<br />
Or well-content that ye have thus reduced<span class="lnm">485</span><br />
Achaia's host, will ye retire to Troy?</p>
<p>  To whom this answer Dolon straight returned<br />
Son of Eumedes. With unfeigning truth<br />
Simply and plainly will I utter all.<br />
Hector, with all the Senatorial Chiefs,<span class="lnm">490</span><br />
Beside the tomb of sacred Ilius sits<br />
Consulting, from the noisy camp remote.<br />
But for the guards, Hero! concerning whom<br />
<span class="pgnm">252</span><a name="page_252" id="page_252"></a>
Thou hast inquired, there is no certain watch<br />
And regular appointed o'er the camp;<span class="lnm">495</span><br />
The native<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_10-17">[17]</a> Trojans (for <i>they</i> can no less)<br />
Sit sleepless all, and each his next exhorts<br />
To vigilance; but all our foreign aids,<br />
Who neither wives nor children hazard here,<br />
Trusting the Trojans for that service, sleep.<span class="lnm">500</span></p>
<p>  To whom Ulysses, ever wise, replied.<br />
How sleep the strangers and allies?&mdash;apart?<br />
Or with the Trojans mingled?&mdash;I would learn.</p>
<p>  So spake Ulysses; to whom Dolon 4hus,<br />
Son of Eumedes. I will all unfold,<span class="lnm">505</span><br />
And all most truly. By the sea are lodged<br />
The Carians, the P&aelig;onians arm'd with bows,<br />
The Leleges, with the Pelasgian band,<br />
And the Caucones. On the skirts encamp<br />
Of Thymbra, the M&aelig;onians crested high,<span class="lnm">510</span><br />
The Phrygian horsemen, with the Lycian host,<br />
And the bold troop of Mysia's haughty sons.<br />
But wherefore these inquiries thus minu4e?<br />
For if ye wish to penetrate the host,<br />
These who possess the borders of the camp<span class="lnm">515</span><br />
Farthest removed of all, are Thracian powers<br />
Newly arrived; among them Rhesus sleeps,<br />
Son of E&iuml;oneus, their Chief and King.<br />
His steeds I saw, the fairest by these eyes<br />
Ever beheld, and loftiest; snow itself<span class="lnm">520</span><br />
They pass in whiteness, and in speed the winds,<br />
With gold and silver all his chariot burns,<br />
And he arrived in golden armor clad<br />
Stupendous! little suited to the state<br />
Of mortal man&mdash;fit for a God to wear!<span class="lnm">525</span><br />
Now, either lead me to your gallant fleet,<br />
Or where ye find me leave me straitly bound<br />
Till ye return, and after trial made,<br />
Shall know if I have spoken false or true.</p>
<p><span class="pgnm">253</span><a name="page_253" id="page_253"></a>
  But him brave Diomede with aspect stern<span class="lnm">530</span><br />
Answer'd. Since, Dolon! thou art caught, although<br />
Thy tidings have been good, hope not to live;<br />
For should we now release thee and dismiss,<br />
Thou wilt revisit yet again the fleet<br />
A spy or open foe; but smitten once<span class="lnm">535</span><br />
By this death-dealing arm, thou shall return<br />
To render mischief to the Greeks no more.</p>
<p>  He ceased, and Dolon would have stretch'd his hand<br />
Toward his beard, and pleaded hard for life,<br />
But with his falchion, rising to the blow,<span class="lnm">540</span><br />
On the mid-neck he smote him, cutting sheer<br />
Both tendons with a stroke so swift, that ere<br />
His tongue had ceased, his head was in the dust.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_10-18">[18]</a><br />
They took his helmet clothed with ferret's felt,<br />
Stripp'd off his wolf-skin, seized his bow and spear,<span class="lnm">545</span><br />
And brave Ulysses lifting in his hand<br />
The trophy to Minerva, pray'd and said:</p>
<p>  Hail Goddess; these are thine! for thee of all<br />
Who in Olympus dwell, we will invoke<br />
First to our aid. Now also guide our steps,<span class="lnm">550</span><br />
Propitious, to the Thracian tents and steeds.</p>
<p>  He ceased, and at arm's-length the lifted spoils<br />
Hung on a tamarisk; but mark'd the spot,<br />
Plucking away with handful grasp the reeds<br />
And spreading boughs, lest they should seek the prize<span class="lnm">555</span><br />
Themselves in vain, returning ere the night,<br />
Swift traveller, should have fled before the dawn.<br />
Thence, o'er the bloody champain strew'd with arms<br />
Proceeding, to the Thracian lines they came.<br />
They, wearied, slept profound; beside them lay,<span class="lnm">560</span><br />
In triple order regular arranged,<br />
Their radiant armor, and their steeds in pairs.<br />
Amid them Rhesus slept, and at his side<br />
His coursers, to the outer chariot-ring<br />
<span class="pgnm">254</span><a name="page_254" id="page_254"></a>
Fasten'd secure. Ulysses saw him first,<span class="lnm">565</span><br />
And, seeing, mark'd him out to Diomede.</p>
<p>  Behold the man, Tydides! Lo! the steeds<br />
By Dolon specified whom we have slain.<br />
Be quick. Exert thy force. Arm'd as thou art,<br />
Sleep not. Loose thou the steeds, or slaughter thou<span class="lnm">570</span><br />
The Thracians, and the steeds shall be my care.</p>
<p>  He ceased; then blue-eyed Pallas with fresh force<br />
Invigor'd Diomede. From side to side<br />
He slew; dread groans arose of dying men<br />
Hewn with the sword, and the earth swam with blood.<span class="lnm">575</span><br />
As if he find a flock unguarded, sheep<br />
Or goats, the lion rushes on his prey,<br />
With such unsparing force Tydides smote<br />
The men of Thrace, till he had slaughter'd twelve;<br />
And whom Tydides with his falchion struck<span class="lnm">580</span><br />
Laertes' son dragg'd by his feet abroad,<br />
Forecasting that the steeds might pass with ease,<br />
Nor start, as yet uncustom'd to the dead.<br />
But when the son of Tydeus found the King,<br />
Him also panting forth his last, last, breath,<span class="lnm">585</span><br />
He added to the twelve; for at his head<br />
An evil dream that night had stood, the form<br />
Of Diomede, by Pallas' art devised.<br />
Meantime, the bold Ulysses loosed the steeds,<br />
Which, to each other rein'd, he drove abroad,<span class="lnm">590</span><br />
Smiting them with his bow (for of the scourge<br />
He thought not in the chariot-seat secured)<br />
And as he went, hiss'd, warning Diomede.<br />
But he, projecting still some hardier deed,<br />
Stood doubtful, whether by the pole to draw<span class="lnm">595</span><br />
The chariot thence, laden with gorgeous arms,<br />
Or whether heaving it on high, to bear<br />
The burthen off, or whether yet to take<br />
More Thracian lives; when him with various thoughts<br />
Perplex'd, Minerva, drawing near, bespake.<span class="lnm">600</span></p>
<p>  Son of bold Tydeus! think on thy return<br />
To yonder fleet, lest thou depart constrain'd.<br />
<span class="pgnm">255</span><a name="page_255" id="page_255"></a>
Some other God may rouse the powers of Troy.</p>
<p>  She ended, and he knew the voice divine.<br />
At once he mounted. With his bow the steeds<span class="lnm">605</span><br />
Ulysses plyed, and to the ships they flew.</p>
<p>  Nor look'd the bender of the silver bow,<br />
Apollo, forth in vain, but at the sight<br />
Of Pallas following Diomede incensed,<br />
Descended to the field where numerous most<span class="lnm">610</span><br />
He saw the Trojans, and the Thracian Chief<br />
And counsellor, Hippoco&ouml;n aroused,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_10-19">[19]</a><br />
Kinsman of Rhesus, and renown'd in arms.<br />
He, starting from his sleep, soon as he saw<br />
The spot deserted where so lately lay<span class="lnm">615</span><br />
Those fiery coursers, and his warrior friends<br />
Gasping around him, sounded loud the name<br />
Of his loved Rhesus. Instant, at the voice,<br />
Wild stir arose and clamorous uproar<br />
Of fast-assembling Trojans. Deeds they saw&mdash;<span class="lnm">620</span><br />
Terrible deeds, and marvellous perform'd,<br />
But not their authors&mdash;they had sought the ships.</p>
<p>  Meantime arrived where they had slain the spy<br />
Of Hector, there Ulysses, dear to Jove,<br />
The coursers stay'd, and, leaping to the ground,<span class="lnm">625</span><br />
The son of Tydeus in Ulysses' hands<br />
The arms of Dolon placed foul with his blood,<br />
Then vaulted light into his seat again.<br />
He lash'd the steeds, they, not unwilling, flew<br />
To the deep-bellied barks, as to their home.<span class="lnm">630</span><br />
First Nestor heard the sound, and thus he said.</p>
<p>  Friends! Counsellors! and leaders of the Greeks!<br />
False shall I speak, or true?&mdash;but speak I must.<br />
The echoing sound of hoofs alarms my ear.<br />
Oh, that Ulysses, and brave Diomede<span class="lnm">635</span><br />
This moment might arrive drawn into camp<br />
By Trojan steeds! But, ah, the dread I feel!<br />
Lest some disaster have for ever quell'd<br />

In yon rude host those noblest of the Greeks.</p>
<p>  He hath not ended, when themselves arrived,<span class="lnm">640</span><br />
Both quick dismounted; joy at their return<br />
Fill'd every bosom; each with kind salute<br />
Cordial, and right-hand welcome greeted them,<br />
And first Gerenian Nestor thus inquired.</p>
<p>  Oh Chief by all extoll'd, glory of Greece,<span class="lnm">645</span><br />
Ulysses! how have ye these steeds acquired?<br />
In yonder host? or met ye as ye went<br />
Some God who gave them to you? for they show<br />
A lustre dazzling as the beams of day.<br />
Old as I am, I mingle yet in fight<span class="lnm">650</span><br />
With Ilium's sons&mdash;lurk never in the fleet&mdash;<br />
Yet saw I at no time, or have remark'd<br />
Steeds such as these; which therefore I believe<br />
Perforce, that ye have gained by gift divine;<br />
For cloud-assembler Jove, and azure-eyed<span class="lnm">655</span><br />
Minerva, Jove's own daughter, love you both.</p>
<p>  To whom Ulysses, thus, discreet, replied.<br />
Neleian Nestor, glory of the Greeks!<br />
A God, so willing, could have given us steeds<br />
Superior, for their bounty knows no bounds.<span class="lnm">660</span><br />
But, venerable Chief! these which thou seest<br />
Are Thracians new-arrived. Their master lies<br />
Slain by the valiant Diomede, with twelve<br />
The noblest of his warriors at his side,<br />
A thirteenth<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_10-20">[20]</a> also, at small distance hence<span class="lnm">665</span><br />
We slew, by Hector and the Chiefs of Troy<br />
Sent to inspect the posture of our host.</p>
<p>  He said; then, high in exultation, drove<br />
The coursers o'er the trench, and with him pass'd<br />
The glad Achaians; at the spacious tent<span class="lnm">670</span><br />
Of Diomede arrived, with even thongs<br />
They tied them at the cribs where stood the steeds<br />
Of Tydeus' son, with winnow'd wheat supplied.<br />
<span class="pgnm">257</span><a name="page_257" id="page_257"></a>
Ulysses in his bark the gory spoils<br />
Of Dolon placed, designing them a gift<span class="lnm">675</span><br />
To Pallas. Then, descending to the sea,<br />
Neck, thighs, and legs from sweat profuse they cleansed,<br />
And, so refresh'd and purified, their last<br />
Ablution in bright tepid baths perform'd.<br />
Each thus completely laved, and with smooth oil<span class="lnm">680</span><br />
Anointed, at the well-spread board they sat,<br />
And quaff'd, in honor of Minerva, wine<br />
Delicious, from the brimming beaker drawn.</p>

<p>The vividness of the scenes presented to us in this Book constitute its chief
beauty. The reader sees the most natural night-scene in the world. He is
led step by step with the adventurers, and made the companion of all their
expectations and uncertainties. We see the very color of the sky; know the
time to a minute; are impatient while the heroes are arming; our imagination
follows them, knows all their doubts, and even the secret wishes of their
hearts sent up to Minerva. We are alarmed at the approach of Dolon, hear
his very footsteps, assist the two chiefs in pursuing him, and stop just with
the spear that arrests him. We are perfectly acquainted with the situation
of all the forces, with the figure in which they lie, with the disposition of
Rhesus and the Thracians, with the posture of his chariot and horses. The
marshy spot of ground where Dolon is killed, the tamarisk, or aquatic plant
upon which they hung his spoils, and the reeds that are heaped together
to mark the place, are circumstances the most picturesque imaginable.</p>

<p class="outd">Agamemnon distinguishes himself. He is wounded, and retires. Diomede
is wounded by Paris; Ulysses by Socus. Ajax with Menelaus flies to
the relief of Ulysses, and Eurypylus, soon after, to the relief of Ajax.
While he is employed in assisting Ajax, he is shot in the thigh by Paris,
who also wounds Machaon. Nestor conveys Machaon from the field.
Achilles dispatches Patroclus to the tent of Nestor, and Nestor takes that
occasion to exhort Patroclus to engage in battle, clothed in the armor of
Achilles.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="noind">Aurora from Tithonus' side arose<br />
With light for heaven and earth, when Jove dispatch'd<br />
Discord, the fiery signal in her hand<br />
Of battle bearing, to the Grecian fleet.<br />
High on Ulysses' huge black ship she stood<span class="lnm">5</span><br />
The centre of the fleet, whence all might hear,<br />
The tent of Telamon's huge son between,<br />
And of Achilles; for confiding they<br />
In their heroic fortitude, their barks<br />
Well-poised had station'd utmost of the line.<span class="lnm">10</span><br />
There standing, shrill she sent a cry abroad<br />
Among the Achaians, such as thirst infused<br />
Of battle ceaseless into every breast.<br />
All deem'd, at once, war sweeter, than to seek<br />
Their native country through the waves again.<span class="lnm">15</span><br />
Then with loud voice Atrides bade the Greeks<br />
Gird on their armor, and himself his arms<br />
Took radiant. First around his legs he clasp'd<br />
His shining greaves with silver studs secured,<br />
Then bound his corselet to his bosom, gift<span class="lnm">20</span><br />
Of Cynyras long since;<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_11-1">[1]</a> for rumor loud<br />
Had Cyprus reached of an Achaian host<br />
Assembling, destined to the shores of Troy:<br />
Wherefore, to gratify the King of men,<br />
<span class="pgnm">262</span><a name="page_262" id="page_262"></a>
He made the splendid ornament his own.<span class="lnm">25</span><br />
Ten rods of steel c&oelig;rulean all around<br />
Embraced it, twelve of gold, twenty of tin;<br />
Six<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_11-2">[2]</a> spiry serpents their uplifted heads<br />
C&oelig;rulean darted at the wearer's throat,<br />
Splendor diffusing as the various bow<span class="lnm">30</span><br />
Fix'd by Saturnian Jove in showery clouds,<br />
A sign to mortal men.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_11-3">[3]</a> He slung his sword<br />
Athwart his shoulders; dazzling bright it shone<br />
With gold emboss'd, and silver was the sheath<br />
Suspended graceful in a belt of gold.<span class="lnm">35</span><br />
His massy shield o'ershadowing him whole,<br />
High-wrought and beautiful, he next assumed.<br />
Ten circles bright of brass around its field<br />
Extensive, circle within circle, ran;<br />
The central boss was black, but hemm'd about<span class="lnm">40</span><br />
With twice ten bosses of resplendent tin.<br />
There, dreadful ornament! the visage dark<br />
Of Gorgon scowl'd, border'd by Flight and Fear.<br />
The loop was silver, and a serpent form<br />
C&oelig;rulean over all its surface twined,<span class="lnm">45</span><br />
Three heads erecting on one neck, the heads<br />
Together wreath'd into a stately crown.<br />
His helmet qu&acirc;tre-crested,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_11-4">[4]</a> and with studs<br />
Fast riveted around he to his brows<br />
Adjusted, whence tremendous waved his crest<span class="lnm">50</span><br />
Of mounted hair on high. Two spears he seized<br />
<span class="pgnm">263</span><a name="page_263" id="page_263"></a>
Ponderous, brass-pointed, and that flash'd to heaven.<br />
Sounds<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_11-5">[5]</a> like clear thunder, by the spouse of Jove<br />
And by Minerva raised to extol the King<br />
Of opulent Mycen&aelig;, roll'd around.<span class="lnm">55</span><br />
At once each bade his charioteer his steeds<br />
Hold fast beside the margin of the trench<br />
In orderly array; the foot all arm'd<br />
Rush'd forward, and the clamor of the host<br />
Rose infinite into the dawning skies.<span class="lnm">60</span><br />
First, at the trench, the embattled infantry<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_11-6">[6]</a><br />
Stood ranged; the chariots follow'd close behind;<br />
Dire was the tumult by Saturnian Jove<br />
Excited, and from ether down he shed<br />
Blood-tinctured dews among them, for he meant<span class="lnm">65</span><br />
That day to send full many a warrior bold<br />
To Pluto's dreary realm, slain premature.</p>
<p>  Opposite, on the rising-ground, appear'd<br />
The Trojans; them majestic Hector led,<br />
Noble Polydamas, &AElig;neas raised<span class="lnm">70</span><br />
To godlike honors in all Trojan hearts,<br />
And Polybus, with whom Antenor's sons<br />
Agenor, and young Acamas advanced.<br />
Hector the splendid orb of his broad shield<br />
Bore in the van, and as a comet now<span class="lnm">75</span><br />
Glares through the clouds portentous, and again,<br />
Obscured by gloomy vapors, disappears,<br />
So Hector, marshalling his host, in front<br />
Now shone, now vanish'd in the distant rear.<br />
All-cased he flamed in brass, and on the sight<span class="lnm">80</span><br />
Flash'd as the lightnings of Jove &AElig;gis-arm'd.<br />
As reapers, toiling opposite,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_11-7">[7]</a> lay bare<br />
Some rich man's furrows, while the sever'd grain,<br />
<span class="pgnm">264</span><a name="page_264" id="page_264"></a>
Barley or wheat, sinks as the sickle moves,<br />
So Greeks and Trojans springing into fight<span class="lnm">85</span><br />
Slew mutual; foul retreat alike they scorn'd,<br />
Alike in fierce hostility their heads<br />
Both bore aloft, and rush'd like wolves to war.<br />
Discord, spectatress terrible, that sight<br />
Beheld exulting; she, of all the Gods,<span class="lnm">90</span><br />
Alone was present; not a Power beside<br />
There interfered, but each his bright abode<br />
Quiescent occupied wherever built<br />
Among the windings of the Olympian heights;<br />
Yet blamed they all the storm-assembler King<span class="lnm">95</span><br />
Saturnian, for his purposed aid to Troy.<br />
The eternal father reck'd not; he, apart,<br />
Seated in solitary pomp, enjoy'd<br />
His glory, and from on high the towers survey'd<br />
Of Ilium and the fleet of Greece, the flash<span class="lnm">100</span><br />
Of gleaming arms, the slayer and the slain.</p>
<p>  While morning lasted, and the light of day<br />
Increased, so long the weapons on both sides<br />
Flew in thick vollies, and the people fell.<br />
But, what time his repast the woodman spreads<span class="lnm">105</span><br />
In some umbrageous vale, his sinewy arms<br />
Wearied with hewing many a lofty tree,<br />
And his wants satisfied, he feels at length<br />
The pinch of appetite to pleasant food,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_11-8">[8]</a><br />
Then was it, that encouraging aloud<span class="lnm">110</span><br />
Each other, in their native virtue strong,<br />
The Grecians through the phalanx burst of Troy.<br />
Forth sprang the monarch first; he slew the Chief<br />
Bianor, nor himself alone, but slew<br />
O&iuml;leus also driver of his steeds.<span class="lnm">115</span><br />
O&iuml;leus, with a leap alighting, rush'd<br />
On Agamemnon; he his fierce assault<br />
Encountering, with a spear met full his front.<br />
Nor could his helmet's ponderous brass sustain<br />
<span class="pgnm">265</span><a name="page_265" id="page_265"></a>
That force, but both his helmet and his skull<span class="lnm">120</span><br />
It shatter'd, and his martial rage repress'd.<br />
The King of men, stripping their corselets, bared<br />
Their shining breasts, and left them. Isus, next,<br />
And Antiphus he flew to slay, the sons<br />
Of Priam both, and in one chariot borne,<span class="lnm">125</span><br />
This spurious, genuine that. The bastard drove,<br />
And Antiphus, a warrior high-renown'd,<br />
Fought from the chariot; them Achilles erst<br />
Feeding their flocks on Ida had surprised<br />
And bound with osiers, but for ransom loosed.<span class="lnm">130</span><br />
Of these, imperial Agamemnon, first,<br />
Above the pap pierced Isus; next, he smote<br />
Antiphus with his sword beside the ear,<br />
And from his chariot cast him to the ground.<br />
Conscious of both, their glittering arms he stripp'd,<span class="lnm">135</span><br />
For he had seen them when from Ida's heights<br />
Achilles led them to the Grecian fleet.<br />
As with resistless fangs the lion breaks<br />
The young in pieces of the nimble hind,<br />
Entering her lair, and takes their feeble lives;<span class="lnm">140</span><br />
She, though at hand, can yield them no defence,<br />
But through the thick wood, wing'd with terror, starts<br />
Herself away, trembling at such a foe;<br />
So them the Trojans had no power to save,<br />
Themselves all driven before the host of Greece.<span class="lnm">145</span><br />
Next, on Pisandrus, and of dauntless heart<br />
Hippolochus he rush'd; they were the sons<br />
Of brave Antimachus, who with rich gifts<br />
By Paris bought, inflexible withheld<br />
From Menelaus still his lovely bride.<span class="lnm">150</span><br />
His sons, the monarch, in one chariot borne<br />
Encounter'd; they (for they had lost the reins)<br />
With trepidation and united force<br />
Essay'd to check the steeds; astonishment<br />
Seized both; Atrides with a lion's rage<span class="lnm">155</span><br />
Came on, and from the chariot thus they sued.</p>
<p>  Oh spare us! son of Atreus, and accept<br />
<span class="pgnm">266</span><a name="page_266" id="page_266"></a>
Ransom immense. Antimachus our sire<br />
Is rich in various treasure, gold and brass,<br />
And temper'd steel, and, hearing the report<span class="lnm">160</span><br />
That in Achaia's fleet his sons survive,<br />
He will requite thee with a glorious price.</p>
<p>  So they, with tears and gentle terms the King<br />
Accosted, but no gentle answer heard.</p>
<p>  Are ye indeed the offspring of the Chief<span class="lnm">165</span><br />
Antimachus, who when my brother once<br />
With godlike Laertiades your town<br />
Enter'd ambassador, his death advised<br />
In council, and to let him forth no more?<br />
Now rue ye both the baseness of your sire.<span class="lnm">170</span></p>
<p>  He said, and from his chariot to the plain<br />
Thrust down Pisandrus, piercing with keen lance<br />
His bosom, and supine he smote the field.<br />
Down leap'd Hippolochus, whom on the ground<br />
He slew, cut sheer his hands, and lopp'd his head,<span class="lnm">175</span><br />
And roll'd it like a mortar<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_11-9">[9]</a> through the ranks.<br />
He left the slain, and where he saw the field<br />
With thickest battle cover'd, thither flew<br />
By all the Grecians follow'd bright in arms.<br />
The scatter'd infantry constrained to fly,<span class="lnm">180</span><br />
Fell by the infantry; the charioteers,<br />
While with loud hoofs their steeds the dusty soil<br />
Excited, o'er the charioteers their wheels<br />
Drove brazen-fellied, and the King of men<br />
Incessant slaughtering, called his Argives<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_11-10">[10]</a> on.<span class="lnm">185</span><br />
As when fierce flames some ancient forest seize,<br />
From side to side in flakes the various wind<br />
Rolls them, and to the roots devour'd, the trunks<br />
Fall prostrate under fury of the fire,<br />
So under Agamemnon fell the heads<span class="lnm">190</span><br />
Of flying Trojans. Many a courser proud<br />
<span class="pgnm">267</span><a name="page_267" id="page_267"></a>
The empty chariots through the paths of war<br />
Whirl'd rattling, of their charioteers deprived;<br />
They breathless press'd the plain, now fitter far<br />
To feed the vultures than to cheer their wives.<span class="lnm">195</span></p>
<p>  Conceal'd, meantime, by Jove, Hector escaped<br />
The dust, darts, deaths, and tumult of the field;<br />
And Agamemnon to the swift pursuit<br />
Call'd loud the Grecians. Through the middle plain<br />
Beside the sepulchre of Ilus, son<span class="lnm">200</span><br />
Of Dardanus, and where the fig-tree stood,<br />
The Trojans flew, panting to gain the town,<br />
While Agamemnon pressing close the rear,<br />
Shout after shout terrific sent abroad,<br />
And his victorious hands reek'd, red with gore.<span class="lnm">205</span><br />
But at the beech-tree and the Sc&aelig;an gate<br />
Arrived, the Trojans halted, waiting there<br />
The rearmost fugitives; they o'er the field<br />
Came like a herd, which in the dead of night<br />
A lion drives; all fly, but one is doom'd<span class="lnm">210</span><br />
To death inevitable; her with jaws<br />
True to their hold he seizes, and her neck<br />
Breaking, embowels her, and laps the blood;<br />
So, Atreus' royal son, the hindmost still<br />
Slaying, and still pursuing, urged them on.<span class="lnm">215</span><br />
Many supine, and many prone, the field<br />
Press'd, by the son of Atreus in their flight<br />
Dismounted; for no weapon raged as his.<br />
But now, at last, when he should soon have reach'd<br />
The lofty walls of Ilium, came the Sire<span class="lnm">220</span><br />
Of Gods and men descending from the skies,<br />
And on the heights of Ida fountain-fed,<br />
Sat arm'd with thunders. Calling to his foot<br />
Swift Iris golden-pinion'd, thus he spake.</p>
<p>  Iris! away. Thus speak in Hector's ears.<span class="lnm">225</span><br />
While yet he shall the son of Atreus see<br />
Fierce warring in the van, and mowing down<br />
The Trojan ranks, so long let him abstain<br />
From battle, leaving to his host the task<br />
<span class="pgnm">268</span><a name="page_268" id="page_268"></a>
Of bloody contest furious with the Greeks.<span class="lnm">230</span><br />
But soon as Atreus' son by spear or shaft<br />
Wounded shall climb his chariot, with such force<br />
I will endue Hector, that he shall slay<br />
Till he have reach'd the ships, and till, the sun<br />
Descending, sacred darkness cover all.<span class="lnm">235</span></p>
<p>  He spake, nor rapid Iris disobey'd<br />
Storm-wing'd ambassadress, but from the heights<br />
Of Ida stoop'd to Ilium. There she found<br />
The son of royal Priam by the throng<br />
Of chariots and of steeds compass'd about<span class="lnm">240</span><br />
She, standing at his side, him thus bespake.</p>
<p>  Oh, son of Priam! as the Gods discreet!<br />
I bring thee counsel from the Sire of all.<br />
While yet thou shalt the son of Atreus see<br />
Fierce warring in the van, and mowing down<span class="lnm">245</span><br />
The warrior ranks, so long he bids thee pause<br />
From battle, leaving to thy host the task<br />
Of bloody contest furious with the Greeks.<br />
But soon as Atreus' son, by spear or shaft<br />
Wounded, shall climb his chariot, Jove will then<span class="lnm">250</span><br />
Endue thee with such force, that thou shalt slay<br />
Till thou have reach'd the ships, and till, the sun<br />
Descending, sacred darkness cover all.</p>
<p>  So saying, swift-pinion'd Iris disappear'd.<br />
Then Hector from his chariot at a leap<span class="lnm">255</span><br />
Came down all arm'd, and, shaking his bright spears,<br />
Ranged every quarter, animating loud<br />
The legions, and rekindling horrid war.<br />
Back roll'd the Trojan ranks, and faced the Greeks;<br />
The Greeks their host to closer phalanx drew;<span class="lnm">260</span><br />
The battle was restored, van fronting van<br />
They stood, and Agamemnon into fight<br />
Sprang foremost, panting for superior fame.</p>
<p>  Say now, ye Nine, who on Olympus dwell!<br />
What Trojan first, or what ally of Troy<span class="lnm">265</span><br />
Opposed the force of Agamemnon's arm?<br />
Iphidamas, Antenor's valiant son,<br />
<span class="pgnm">269</span><a name="page_269" id="page_269"></a>
Of loftiest stature, who in fertile Thrace<br />
Mother of flocks was nourish'd, Cisseus him<br />
His grandsire, father of Theano praised<span class="lnm">270</span><br />
For loveliest features, in his own abode<br />
Rear'd yet a child, and when at length he reach'd<br />
The measure of his glorious manhood firm<br />
Dismiss'd him not, but, to engage him more,<br />
Gave him his daughter. Wedded, he his bride<span class="lnm">275</span><br />
As soon deserted, and with galleys twelve<br />
Following the rumor'd voyage of the Greeks,<br />
The same course steer'd; but at Percope moor'd,<br />
And marching thence, arrived on foot at Troy.<br />
He first opposed Atrides. They approach'd.<span class="lnm">280</span><br />
The spear of Agamemnon wander'd wide;<br />
But him Iphidamas on his broad belt<br />
Beneath the corselet struck, and, bearing still<br />
On his spear-beam, enforced it; but ere yet<br />
He pierced the broider'd zone, his point, impress'd<span class="lnm">285</span><br />
Against the silver, turn'd, obtuse as lead.<br />
Then royal Agamemnon in his hand<br />
The weapon grasping, with a lion's rage<br />
Home drew it to himself, and from his gripe<br />
Wresting it, with his falchion keen his neck<span class="lnm">290</span><br />
Smote full, and stretch'd him lifeless at his foot.<br />
So slept Iphidamas among the slain;<br />
Unhappy! from his virgin bride remote,<br />
Associate with the men of Troy in arms<br />
He fell, and left her beauties unenjoy'd.<span class="lnm">295</span><br />
He gave her much, gave her a hundred beeves,<br />
And sheep and goats a thousand from his flocks<br />
Promised, for numberless his meadows ranged;<br />
But Agamemnon, son of Atreus, him<br />
Slew and despoil'd, and through the Grecian host<span class="lnm">300</span><br />
Proceeded, laden with his gorgeous arms.<br />
Co&ouml;n that sight beheld, illustrious Chief,<br />
Antenor's eldest born, but with dim eyes<br />
Through anguish for his brother's fall. Unseen<br />
Of noble Agamemnon, at his side<span class="lnm">305</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">270</span><a name="page_270" id="page_270"></a>
He cautious stood, and with a spear his arm,<br />
Where thickest flesh'd, below his elbow, pierced,<br />
Till opposite the glittering point appear'd.<br />
A thrilling horror seized the King of men<br />
So wounded; yet though wounded so, from fight<span class="lnm">310</span><br />
He ceased not, but on Co&ouml;n rush'd, his spear<br />
Grasping, well-thriven growth<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_11-11">[11]</a> of many a wind.<br />
He by the foot drew off Iphidamas,<br />
His brother, son of his own sire, aloud<br />
Calling the Trojan leaders to his aid;<span class="lnm">315</span><br />
When him so occupied with his keen point<br />
Atrides pierced his bossy shield beneath.<br />
Expiring on Iphidamas he fell<br />
Prostrate, and Agamemnon lopp'd his head.<br />
Thus, under royal Agamemnon's hand,<span class="lnm">320</span><br />
Antenor's sons their destiny fulfill'd,<br />
And to the house of Ades journey'd both.<br />
Through other ranks of warriors then he pass'd,<br />
Now with his spear, now with his falchion arm'd,<br />
And now with missile force of massy stones,<span class="lnm">325</span><br />
While yet his warm blood sallied from the wound.<br />
But when the wound grew dry, and the blood ceased,<br />
Anguish intolerable undermined<br />
Then all the might of Atreus' royal son.<br />
As when a laboring woman's arrowy throes<span class="lnm">330</span><br />
Seize her intense, by Juno's daughters dread<br />
The birth-presiding Ilithy&aelig; deep<br />
Infixt, dispensers of those pangs severe;<br />
So, anguish insupportable subdued<br />
Then all the might of Atreus' royal son.<span class="lnm">335</span><br />
Up-springing to his seat, instant he bade<br />
His charioteer drive to the hollow barks,<br />
Heart-sick himself with pain; yet, ere he went,<br />
With voice loud-echoing hail'd the Dana&iuml;.</p>
<p>  Friends! counsellors and leaders of the Greeks!<span class="lnm">340</span><br />
Now drive, yourselves, the battle from your ships.<br />
For me the Gods permit not to employ<br />
<span class="pgnm">271</span><a name="page_271" id="page_271"></a>
In fight with Ilium's host the day entire.</p>
<p>  He ended, and the charioteer his steeds<br />
Lash'd to the ships; they not unwilling flew,<span class="lnm">345</span><br />
Bearing from battle the afflicted King<br />
With foaming chests and bellies grey with dust.<br />
Soon Hector, noting his retreat, aloud<br />
Call'd on the Trojans and allies of Troy.</p>
<p>  Trojans and Lycians, and close-fighting sons<span class="lnm">350</span><br />
Of Dardanus! oh summon all your might;<br />
Now, now be men! Their bravest is withdrawn!<br />
Glory and honor from Saturnian Jove<br />
On me attend; now full against the Greeks<br />
Drive all your steeds, and win a deathless name.<span class="lnm">355</span></p>
<p>  He spake&mdash;and all drew courage from his word.<br />
As when his hounds bright-tooth'd some hunter cheers<br />
Against the lion or the forest-boar,<br />
So Priame&iuml;an Hector cheer'd his host<br />
Magnanimous against the sons of Greece,<span class="lnm">360</span><br />
Terrible as gore-tainted Mars. Among<br />
The foremost warriors, with success elate<br />
He strode, and flung himself into the fight<br />
Black as a storm which sudden from on high<br />
Descending, furrows deep the gloomy flood.<span class="lnm">365</span></p>
<p>  Then whom slew Priame&iuml;an Hector first,<br />
Whom last, by Jove, that day, with glory crown'd?<br />
Ass&aelig;us, Dolops, Orus, Agela&uuml;s,<br />
Autono&uuml;s, Hippono&uuml;s, &AElig;symnus,<br />
Opheltius and Opites first he slew,<span class="lnm">370</span><br />
All leaders of the Greeks, and, after these,<br />
The people. As when whirlwinds of the West<br />
A storm encounter from the gloomy South,<br />
The waves roll multitudinous, and the foam<br />
Upswept by wandering gusts fills all the air,<span class="lnm">375</span><br />
So Hector swept the Grecians. Then defeat<br />
Past remedy and havoc had ensued,<br />
Then had the routed Grecians, flying, sought<br />
Their ships again, but that Ulysses<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_11-12">[12]</a> thus<br />
<span class="pgnm">272</span><a name="page_272" id="page_272"></a>
Summon'd the brave Tydides to his aid.<span class="lnm">380</span></p>
<p>  Whence comes it, Diomede, that we forget<br />
Our wonted courage? Hither, O my friend!<br />
And, fighting at my side, ward off the shame<br />
That must be ours, should Hector seize the fleet.</p>
<p>  To whom the valiant Diomede replied.<span class="lnm">385</span><br />
I will be firm; trust me thou shalt not find<br />
Me shrinking; yet small fruit of our attempts<br />
Shall follow, for the Thunderer, not to us,<br />
But to the Trojan, gives the glorious day.</p>
<p>  The Hero spake, and from his chariot cast<span class="lnm">390</span><br />
Thymbr&aelig;us to the ground pierced through the pap,<br />
While by Ulysses' hand his charioteer<br />
Godlike Molion, fell. The warfare thus<br />
Of both for ever closed, them there they left,<br />
And plunging deep into the warrior-throng<span class="lnm">395</span><br />
Troubled the multitude. As when two boars<br />
Turn desperate on the close-pursuing hounds,<br />
So they, returning on the host of Troy,<br />
Slew on all sides, and overtoil'd with flight<br />
From Hector's arm, the Greeks meantime respired.<span class="lnm">400</span><br />
Two warriors, next, their chariot and themselves<br />
They took, plebeians brave, sons of the seer<br />
Percosian Merops in prophetic skill<br />
Surpassing all; he both his sons forbad<br />
The mortal field, but disobedient they<span class="lnm">405</span><br />
Still sought it, for their destiny prevail'd.<br />
Spear-practised Diomede of life deprived<br />
Both these, and stripp'd them of their glorious arms,<br />
While by Ulysses' hand Hippodamus<br />
Died and Hypeirochus. And now the son<span class="lnm">410</span><br />
Of Saturn, looking down from Ida, poised<br />
The doubtful war, and mutual deaths they dealt.<br />
Tydides plunged his spear into the groin<br />
Of the illustrious son of P&aelig;on, bold<br />
<span class="pgnm">273</span><a name="page_273" id="page_273"></a>
Agastrophus. No steeds at his command<span class="lnm">415</span><br />
Had he, infatuate! but his charioteer<br />
His steeds detain'd remote, while through the van<br />
Himself on foot rush'd madly till he fell.<br />
But Hector through the ranks darting his eye<br />
Perceived, and with ear-piercing cries advanced<span class="lnm">420</span><br />
Against them, follow'd by the host of Troy.<br />
The son of Tydeus, shuddering, his approach<br />
Discern'd, and instant to Ulysses spake.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_11-13">[13]</a></p>
<p>  Now comes the storm! This way the mischief rolls!<br />
Stand and repulse the Trojan. Now be firm.<span class="lnm">425</span></p>
<p>  He said, and hurling his long-shadow'd beam<br />
Smote Hector. At his helmet's crown he aim'd,<br />
Nor err'd, but brass encountering brass, the point<br />
Glanced wide, for he had cased his youthful brows<br />
In triple brass, Apollo's glorious gift.<span class="lnm">430</span><br />
Yet with rapidity at such a shock<br />
Hector recoil'd into the multitude<br />
Afar, where sinking to his knees, he lean'd<br />
On his broad palm, and darkness veil'd his eyes.<br />
But while Tydides follow'd through the van<span class="lnm">435</span><br />
His stormy spear, which in the distant soil<br />
Implanted stood, Hector his scatter'd sense<br />
Recovering, to his chariot sprang again,<br />
And, diving deep into his host, escaped.<br />
The noble son of Tydeus, spear in hand,<span class="lnm">440</span><br />
Rush'd after him, and as he went, exclaim'd.</p>
<p>  Dog! thou hast now escaped; but, sure the stroke<br />
Approach'd thee nigh, well-aim'd. Once more thy prayers<br />
Which ever to Apollo thou prefer'st<br />
Entering the clash of battle, have prevail'd,<span class="lnm">445</span><br />
And he hath rescued thee. But well beware<br />
Our next encounter, for if also me<br />
Some God befriend, thou diest. Now will I seek<br />
Another mark, and smite whom next I may.</p>
<p>  He spake, and of his armor stripp'd the son<span class="lnm">450</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">274</span><a name="page_274" id="page_274"></a>
Spear-famed of P&aelig;on. Meantime Paris, mate<br />
Of beauteous Helen, drew his bow against<br />
Tydides; by a pillar of the tomb<br />
Of Ilus, ancient senator revered,<br />
Conceal'd he stood, and while the Hero loosed<span class="lnm">455</span><br />
His corselet from the breast of P&aelig;on's son<br />
Renown'd, and of his helmet and his targe<br />
Despoil'd him; Paris, arching quick his bow,<br />
No devious shaft dismiss'd, but his right foot<br />
Pierced through the sole, and fix'd it to the ground.<span class="lnm">460</span><br />
Transported from his ambush forth he leap'd<br />
With a loud laugh, and, vaunting, thus exclaim'd:</p>
<p>  Oh shaft well shot! it galls thee. Would to heaven<br />
That it had pierced thy heart, and thou hadst died!<br />
So had the Trojans respite from their toils<span class="lnm">465</span><br />
Enjoy'd, who, now, shudder at sight of thee<br />
Like she-goats when the lion is at hand.</p>
<p>  To whom, undaunted, Diomede replied.<br />
Archer shrew-tongued! spie-maiden! man of curls!<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_11-14">[14]</a><br />
Shouldst thou in arms attempt me face to face,<span class="lnm">470</span><br />
Thy bow and arrows should avail thee nought.<br />
Vain boaster! thou hast scratch'd my foot&mdash;no more&mdash;<br />
And I regard it as I might the stroke<br />
Of a weak woman or a simple child.<br />
The weapons of a dastard and a slave<span class="lnm">475</span><br />
Are ever such. More terrible are mine,<br />
And whom they pierce, though slightly pierced, he dies.<br />
His wife her cheeks rends inconsolable,<br />
His babes are fatherless, his blood the glebe<br />
Incarnadines, and where he bleeds and rots<span class="lnm">480</span><br />
More birds of prey than women haunt the place.</p>
<p>  He ended, and Ulysses, drawing nigh,<br />
Shelter'd Tydides; he behind the Chief<br />
<span class="pgnm">275</span><a name="page_275" id="page_275"></a>
Of Ithaca sat drawing forth the shaft,<br />
But pierced with agonizing pangs the while.<span class="lnm">485</span><br />
Then, climbing to his chariot-seat, he bade<br />
Sthenelus hasten to the hollow ships,<br />
Heart-sick with pain. And now alone was seen<br />
Spear-famed Ulysses; not an Argive more<br />
Remain'd, so universal was the rout,<span class="lnm">490</span><br />
And groaning, to his own great heart he said.</p>
<p>  Alas! what now awaits me? If, appall'd<br />
By multitudes, I fly, much detriment;<br />
And if alone they intercept me here,<br />
Still more; for Jove hath scatter'd all the host,<span class="lnm">495</span><br />
Yet why these doubts! for know I not of old<br />
That only dastards fly, and that the voice<br />
Of honor bids the famed in battle stand,<br />
Bleed they themselves, or cause their foes to bleed?</p>
<p>  While busied in such thought he stood, the ranks<span class="lnm">500</span><br />
Of Trojans fronted with broad shields, enclosed<br />
The hero with a ring, hemming around<br />
Their own destruction. As when dogs, and swains<br />
In prime of manhood, from all quarters rush<br />
Around a boar, he from his thicket bolts,<span class="lnm">505</span><br />
The bright tusk whetting in his crooked jaws:<br />
They press him on all sides, and from beneath<br />
Loud gnashings hear, yet firm, his threats defy;<br />
Like them the Trojans on all sides assail'd<br />
Ulysses dear to Jove. First with his spear<span class="lnm">510</span><br />
He sprang impetuous on a valiant chief,<br />
Whose shoulder with a downright point he pierced,<br />
De&iuml;opites; Tho&ouml;n next he slew,<br />
And Ennomus, and from his coursers' backs<br />
Alighting quick, Chersidamas; beneath<span class="lnm">515</span><br />
His bossy shield the gliding weapon pass'd<br />
Right through his navel; on the plain he fell<br />
Expiring, and with both hands clench'd the dust.<br />
Them slain he left, and Charops wounded next,<br />
Brother of Socus, generous Chief, and son<span class="lnm">520</span><br />
Of Hippasus; brave Socus to the aid<br />
<span class="pgnm">276</span><a name="page_276" id="page_276"></a>
Of Charops flew, and, godlike, thus began.</p>
<p>  Illustrious chief, Ulysses! strong to toil<br />
And rich in artifice! Or boast to-day<br />
Two sons of Hippasus, brave warriors both,<span class="lnm">525</span><br />
Of armor and of life bereft by thee,<br />
Or to my vengeful spear resign thy own!</p>
<p>  So saying, Ulysses' oval disk he smote.<br />
Through his bright disk the stormy weapon flew,<br />
Transpierced his twisted mail, and from his side<span class="lnm">530</span><br />
Drove all the skin, but to his nobler parts<br />
Found entrance none, by Pallas turn'd aslant.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_11-15">[15]</a><br />
Ulysses, conscious of his life untouch'd,<br />
Retired a step from Socus, and replied.</p>
<p>  Ah hapless youth; thy fate is on the wing;<span class="lnm">535</span><br />
Me thou hast forced indeed to cease a while<br />
From battle with the Trojans, but I speak<br />
Thy death at hand; for vanquish'd by my spear,<br />
This self-same day thou shalt to me resign<br />
Thy fame, thy soul to Pluto steed-renown'd.<span class="lnm">540</span></p>
<p>  He ceased; then Socus turn'd his back to fly,<br />
But, as he turn'd, his shoulder-blades between<br />
He pierced him, and the spear urged through his breast.<br />
On his resounding arms he fell, and thus<br />
Godlike Ulysses gloried in his fall.<span class="lnm">545</span></p>
<p>  Ah, Socus, son of Hippasus, a chief<br />
Of fame equestrian! swifter far than thou<br />
Death follow'd thee, and thou hast not escaped.<br />
Ill-fated youth! thy parents' hands thine eyes<br />
Shall never close, but birds of ravenous maw<span class="lnm">550</span><br />
Shall tear thee, flapping thee with frequent wing,<br />
While me the noble Grecians shall entomb!</p>
<p>  So saying, the valiant Socus' spear he drew<br />
From his own flesh, and through his bossy shield.<br />
The weapon drawn, forth sprang the blood, and left<span class="lnm">555</span><br />
His spirit faint. Then Ilium's dauntless sons,<br />
<span class="pgnm">277</span><a name="page_277" id="page_277"></a>
Seeing Ulysses' blood, exhorted glad<br />
Each other, and, with force united, all<br />
Press'd on him. He, retiring, summon'd loud<br />
His followers. Thrice, loud as mortal may,<span class="lnm">560</span><br />
He call'd, and valiant Menelaus thrice<br />
Hearing the voice, to Ajax thus remark'd.</p>
<p>  Illustrious son of Telamon! The voice<br />
Of Laertiades comes o'er my ear<br />
With such a sound, as if the hardy chief,<span class="lnm">565</span><br />
Abandon'd of his friends, were overpower'd<br />
By numbers intercepting his retreat.<br />
Haste! force we quick a passage through the ranks.<br />
His worth demands our succor, for I fear<br />
Lest sole conflicting with the host of Troy,<span class="lnm">570</span><br />
Brave as he is, he perish, to the loss<br />
Unspeakable and long regret of Greece.</p>
<p>  So saying, he went, and Ajax, godlike Chief,<br />
Follow'd him. At the voice arrived, they found<br />
Ulysses Jove-beloved compass'd about<span class="lnm">575</span><br />
By Trojans, as the lynxes in the hills,<br />
Adust for blood, compass an antler'd stag<br />
Pierced by an archer; while his blood is warm<br />
And his limbs pliable, from him he 'scapes;<br />
But when the feather'd barb hath quell'd his force,<span class="lnm">580</span><br />
In some dark hollow of the mountain's side,<br />
The hungry troop devour him; chance, the while,<br />
Conducts a lion thither, before whom<br />
All vanish, and the lion feeds alone;<br />
So swarm'd the Trojan powers, numerous and bold,<span class="lnm">585</span><br />
Around Ulysses, who with wary skill<br />
Heroic combated his evil day.<br />
But Ajax came, cover'd with his broad shield<br />
That seem'd a tower, and at Ulysses' side<br />
Stood fast; then fled the Trojans wide-dispersed,<span class="lnm">590</span><br />
And Menelaus led him by the hand<br />
Till his own chariot to his aid approach'd.<br />
But Ajax, springing on the Trojans, slew<br />
Doryclus, from the loins of Priam sprung,<br />
<span class="pgnm">278</span><a name="page_278" id="page_278"></a>
But spurious. Pandocus he wounded next,<span class="lnm">595</span><br />
Then wounded Pyrasus, and after him<br />
Pylartes and Lysander. As a flood<br />
Runs headlong from the mountains to the plain<br />
After long showers from Jove; many a dry oak<br />
And many a pine the torrent sweeps along,<span class="lnm">600</span><br />
And, turbid, shoots much soil into the sea,<br />
So, glorious Ajax troubled wide the field,<br />
Horse and man slaughtering, whereof Hector yet<br />
Heard not; for on the left of all the war<br />
He fought beside Scamander, where around<span class="lnm">605</span><br />
Huge Nestor, and Idomeneus the brave,<br />
Most deaths were dealt, and loudest roar'd the fight.<br />
There Hector toil'd, feats wonderful of spear<br />
And horsemanship achieving, and the lines<br />
Of many a phalanx desolating wide.<span class="lnm">610</span><br />
Nor even then had the bold Greeks retired,<br />
But that an arrow triple-barb'd, dispatch'd<br />
By Paris, Helen's mate, against the Chief<br />
Machaon warring with distinguish'd force,<br />
Pierced his right shoulder. For his sake alarm'd,<span class="lnm">615</span><br />
The valor-breathing Grecians fear'd, lest he<br />
In that disast'rous field should also fall.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_11-16">[16]</a><br />
At once, Idomeneus of Crete approach'd<br />
The noble Nestor, and him thus bespake.</p>
<p>  Arise, Neleian Nestor! Pride of Greece!<span class="lnm">620</span><br />
Ascend thy chariot, and Machaon placed<br />
Beside thee, bear him, instant to the fleet.<br />
For one, so skill'd in medicine, and to free<br />
The inherent barb, is worth a multitude.</p>
<p>  He said, nor the Gerenian hero old<span class="lnm">625</span><br />
Aught hesitated, but into his seat<br />
Ascended, and Machaon, son renown'd<br />
Of &AElig;sculapius, mounted at his side.<br />
He lash'd the steeds, they not unwilling sought<br />
<span class="pgnm">279</span><a name="page_279" id="page_279"></a>
The hollow ships, long their familiar home.<span class="lnm">630</span></p>
<p>  Cebriones, meantime, the charioteer<br />
Of Hector, from his seat the Trojan ranks<br />
Observing sore discomfited, began.</p>
<p>  Here are we busied, Hector! on the skirts<br />
Of roaring battle, and meantime I see<span class="lnm">635</span><br />
Our host confused, their horses and themselves<br />
All mingled. Telamonian Ajax there<br />
Routs them; I know the hero by his shield.<br />
Haste, drive we thither, for the carnage most<br />
Of horse and foot conflicting furious, there<span class="lnm">640</span><br />
Rages, and infinite the shouts arise.</p>
<p>  He said, and with shrill-sounding scourge the steeds<br />
Smote ample-maned; they, at the sudden stroke<br />
Through both hosts whirl'd the chariot, shields and men<br />
Trampling; with blood the axle underneath<span class="lnm">645</span><br />
All redden'd, and the chariot-rings with drops<br />
From the horse-hoofs, and from the fellied wheels.<br />
Full on the multitude he drove, on fire<br />
To burst the phalanx, and confusion sent<br />
Among the Greeks, for nought<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_11-17">[17]</a> he shunn'd the spear.<span class="lnm">650</span><br />
All quarters else with falchion or with lance,<br />
Or with huge stones he ranged, but cautious shunn'd<br />
The encounter of the Telamonian Chief.</p>
<p>  But the eternal father throned on high<br />
With fear fill'd Ajax; panic-fixt he stood,<span class="lnm">655</span><br />
His seven-fold shield behind his shoulder cast,<br />
And hemm'd by numbers, with an eye askant,<br />
Watchful retreated. As a beast of prey<br />
Retiring, turns and looks, so he his face<br />
Turn'd oft, retiring slow, and step by step.<span class="lnm">660</span><br />
As when the watch-dogs and assembled swains<br />
Have driven a tawny lion from the stalls,<br />
Then, interdicting him his wish'd repast,<br />
<span class="pgnm">280</span><a name="page_280" id="page_280"></a>
Watch all the night, he, famish'd, yet again<br />
Comes furious on, but speeds not, kept aloof<span class="lnm">665</span><br />
By frequent spears from daring hands, but more<br />
By flash of torches, which, though fierce, he dreads,<br />
Till, at the dawn, sullen he stalks away;<br />
So from before the Trojans Ajax stalk'd<br />
Sullen, and with reluctance slow retired.<span class="lnm">670</span><br />
His brave heart trembling for the fleet of Greece.<br />
As when (the boys o'erpower'd) a sluggish ass,<br />
On whose tough sides they have spent many a staff,<br />
Enters the harvest, and the spiry ears<br />
Crops persevering; with their rods the boys<span class="lnm">675</span><br />
Still ply him hard, but all their puny might<br />
Scarce drives him forth when he hath browsed his fill,<br />
So, there, the Trojans and their foreign aids<br />
With glittering lances keen huge Ajax urged,<br />
His broad shield's centre smiting.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_11-18">[18]</a> He, by turns,<span class="lnm">680</span><br />
With desperate force the Trojan phalanx dense<br />
Facing, repulsed them, and by turns he fled,<br />
But still forbad all inroad on the fleet.<br />
Trojans and Greeks between, alone, he stood<br />
A bulwark. Spears from daring hands dismiss'd<span class="lnm">685</span><br />
Some, piercing his broad shield, there planted stood,<br />
While others, in the midway falling, spent<br />
Their disappointed rage deep in the ground.</p>
<p><span class="pgnm">281</span><a name="page_281" id="page_281"></a>
  Eurypylus, Ev&aelig;mon's noble son,<br />
Him seeing, thus, with weapons overwhelmed<span class="lnm">690</span><br />
Flew to his side, his glittering lance dismiss'd,<br />
And Apisaon, son of Phausias, struck<br />
Under the midriff; through his liver pass'd<br />
The ruthless point, and, falling, he expired.<br />
Forth sprang Eurypylus to seize the spoil;<span class="lnm">695</span><br />
Whom soon as godlike Alexander saw<br />
Despoiling Apisaon of his arms,<br />
Drawing incontinent his bow, he sent<br />
A shaft to his right thigh; the brittle reed<br />
Snapp'd, and the rankling barb stuck fast within.<span class="lnm">700</span><br />
Terrified at the stroke, the wounded Chief<br />
To his own band retired, but, as he went,<br />
With echoing voice call'd on the Dana&iuml;&mdash;</p>
<p>  Friends! Counsellors, and leaders of the Greeks!<br />
Turn ye and stand, and from his dreadful lot<span class="lnm">705</span><br />
Save Ajax whelm'd with weapons; 'scape, I judge,<br />
He cannot from the roaring fight, yet oh<br />
Stand fast around him; if save ye may,<br />
Your champion huge, the Telamonian Chief!</p>
<p>  So spake the wounded warrior. They at once<span class="lnm">710</span><br />
With sloping bucklers, and with spears erect,<br />
To his relief approach'd. Ajax with joy<br />
The friendly phalanx join'd, then turn'd and stood.</p>
<p>  Thus burn'd the embattled field as with the flames<br />
Of a devouring fire. Meantime afar<span class="lnm">715</span><br />
From all that tumult the Neleian mares<br />
Bore Nestor, foaming as they ran, with whom<br />
Machaon also rode, leader revered.<br />
Achilles mark'd him passing; for he stood<br />
Exalted on his huge ship's lofty stern,<span class="lnm">720</span><br />
Spectator of the toil severe, and flight<br />
Deplorable of the defeated Greeks.<br />
He call'd his friend Patroclus. He below<br />
Within his tent the sudden summons heard<br />
And sprang like Mars abroad, all unaware<span class="lnm">725</span><br />
That in that sound he heard the voice of fate.<br />
<span class="pgnm">282</span><a name="page_282" id="page_282"></a>
Him first Men&oelig;tius' gallant son address'd.</p>
<p>  What would Achilles? Wherefore hath he call'd?<br />
To whom Achilles swiftest of the swift:</p>
<p>  Brave Men&oelig;tiades! my soul's delight!<span class="lnm">730</span><br />
Soon will the Grecians now my knees surround<br />
Suppliant, by dread extremity constrain'd.<br />
But fly Patroclus, haste, oh dear to Jove!<br />
Inquire of Nestor, whom he hath convey'd<br />
From battle, wounded? Viewing him behind,<span class="lnm">735</span><br />
I most believed him &AElig;sculapius' son<br />
Machaon, but the steeds so swiftly pass'd<br />
My galley, that his face escaped my note.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_11-19">[19]</a></p>
<p>  He said, and prompt to gratify his friend,<br />
Forth ran Patroclus through the camp of Greece.<span class="lnm">740</span></p>
<p>  Now when Neleian Nestor to his tent<br />
Had brought Machaon, they alighted both,<br />
And the old hero's friend Eurymedon<br />
Released the coursers. On the beach awhile<br />
Their tunics sweat-imbued in the cool air<span class="lnm">745</span><br />
They ventilated, facing full the breeze,<br />
Then on soft couches in the tent reposed.<br />
Meantime, their beverage Hecamede mix'd,<br />
The old King's bright-hair'd captive, whom he brought<br />
From Tenedos, what time Achilles sack'd<span class="lnm">750</span><br />
The city, daughter of the noble Chief<br />
Arsino&uuml;s, and selected from the rest<br />
For Nestor, as the honorable meed<br />
Of counsels always eminently wise.<br />
She, first, before them placed a table bright,<span class="lnm">755</span><br />
With feet c&oelig;rulean; thirst-provoking sauce<br />
She brought them also in a brazen tray,<br />
<span class="pgnm">283</span><a name="page_283" id="page_283"></a>
Garlic<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_11-20">[20]</a> and honey new, and sacred meal.<br />
Beside them, next, she placed a noble cup<br />
Of labor exquisite, which from his home<span class="lnm">760</span><br />
The ancient King had brought with golden studs<br />
Embellish'd; it presented to the grasp<br />
Four ears; two golden turtles, perch'd on each,<br />
Seem'd feeding, and two turtles<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_11-21">[21]</a> form'd the base.<br />
That cup once fill'd, all others must have toil'd<span class="lnm">765</span><br />
To move it from the board, but it was light<br />
In Nestor's hand; he lifted it with ease.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_11-22">[22]</a><br />
The graceful virgin in that cup a draught<br />
Mix'd for them, Pramnian wine and savory cheese<br />
Of goat's milk, grated with a brazen rasp,<span class="lnm">770</span><br />
Then sprinkled all with meal. The draught prepared,<br />
She gave it to their hand; they, drinking, slaked<br />
Their fiery thirst, and with each other sat<br />
Conversing friendly, when the godlike youth<br />
By brave Achilles sent, stood at the door.<span class="lnm">775</span></p>
<p>  Him seeing, Nestor from his splendid couch<br />
Arose, and by the hand leading him in,<br />
Entreated him to sit, but that request<br />
Patroclus, on his part refusing, said,</p>
<p>  Oh venerable King! no seat is here<span class="lnm">780</span><br />
For me, nor may thy courtesy prevail.<br />
He is irascible, and to be fear'd<br />
Who bade me ask what Chieftain thou hast brought<br />
From battle, wounded; but untold I learn;<br />
I see Machaon, and shall now report<span class="lnm">785</span><br />
As I have seen; oh ancient King revered!<br />
Thou know'st Achilles fiery, and propense<br />
Blame to impute even where blame is none.</p>
<p><span class="pgnm">284</span><a name="page_284" id="page_284"></a>
  To whom the brave Gerenian thus replied.<br />
Why feels Achilles for the wounded Greeks<span class="lnm">790</span><br />
Such deep concern? He little knows the height<br />
To which our sorrows swell. Our noblest lie<br />
By spear or arrow wounded in the fleet.<br />
Diomede, warlike son of Tydeus, bleeds,<br />
Gall'd by a shaft; Ulysses, glorious Chief,<span class="lnm">795</span><br />
And Agamemnon<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_11-23">[23]</a> suffer by the spear;<br />
Eurypylus is shot into the thigh,<br />
And here lies still another newly brought<br />
By me from fight, pierced also by a shaft.<br />
What then? How strong soe'er to give them aid,<span class="lnm">800</span><br />
Achilles feels no pity of the Greeks.<br />
Waits he till every vessel on the shore<br />
Fired, in despite of the whole Argive host,<br />
Be sunk in its own ashes, and ourselves<br />
All perish, heaps on heaps? For in my limbs<span class="lnm">805</span><br />
No longer lives the agility of my youth.<br />
Oh, for the vigor of those days again,<br />
When Elis, for her cattle which we took,<br />
Strove with us and Itymoneus I slew,<br />
Brave offspring of Hypirochus; he dwelt<span class="lnm">810</span><br />
In Elis, and while I the pledges drove,<br />
Stood for his herd, but fell among the first<br />
By a spear hurl'd from my victorious arm.<br />
Then fled the rustic multitude, and we<br />
Drove off abundant booty from the plain,<span class="lnm">815</span><br />
Herds fifty of fat beeves, large flocks of goats<br />
As many, with as many sheep and swine,<br />
And full thrice fifty mares of brightest hue,<br />
All breeders, many with their foals beneath.<br />
All these, by night returning safe, we drove<span class="lnm">820</span><br />
Into Neleian Pylus, and the heart<br />
Rejoiced of Neleus, in a son so young<br />
A warrior, yet enrich'd with such a prize.<br />
<span class="pgnm">285</span><a name="page_285" id="page_285"></a>
At early dawn the heralds summon'd loud<br />
The citizens, to prove their just demands<span class="lnm">825</span><br />
On fruitful Elis, and the assembled Chiefs<br />
Division made (for numerous were the debts<br />
Which the Epeans, in the weak estate<br />
Of the unpeopled Pylus, had incurr'd;<br />
For Hercules, few years before, had sack'd<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_11-24">[24]</a><span class="lnm">830</span><br />
Our city, and our mightiest slain. Ourselves<br />
The gallant sons of Neleus, were in all<br />
Twelve youths, of whom myself alone survived;<br />
The rest all perish'd; whence, presumptuous grown,<br />
The brazen-mail'd Epeans wrong'd us oft).<span class="lnm">835</span><br />
A herd of beeves my father for himself<br />
Selected, and a numerous flock beside,<br />
Three hundred sheep, with shepherds for them all.<br />
For he a claimant was of large arrears<br />
From sacred Elis. Four unrivall'd steeds<span class="lnm">840</span><br />
With his own chariot to the games he sent,<br />
That should contend for the appointed prize<br />
A tripod; but Augeias, King of men,<br />
Detain'd the steeds, and sent the charioteer<br />
Defrauded home. My father, therefore, fired<span class="lnm">845</span><br />
At such foul outrage both of deeds and words,<br />
Took much, and to the Pylians gave the rest<br />
For satisfaction of the claims of all.<br />
While thus we busied were in these concerns,<br />
And in performance of religious rites<span class="lnm">850</span><br />
Throughout the city, came the Epeans arm'd,<br />
Their whole vast multitude both horse and foot<br />
On the third day; came also clad in brass<br />
The two Molions, inexpert as yet<br />
In feats of arms, and of a boyish age.<span class="lnm">855</span><br />
There is a city on a mountain's head,<br />
Fast by the banks of Alpheus, far remote,<br />
The utmost town which sandy Pylus owns,<br />
<span class="pgnm">286</span><a name="page_286" id="page_286"></a>
Named Thryo&euml;ssa, and, with ardor fired<br />
To lay it waste, that city they besieged.<span class="lnm">860</span><br />
Now when their host had traversed all the plain,<br />
Minerva from Olympus flew by night<br />
And bade us arm; nor were the Pylians slow<br />
To assemble, but impatient for the fight.<br />
Me, then, my father suffer'd not to arm,<span class="lnm">865</span><br />
But hid my steeds, for he supposed me raw<br />
As yet, and ignorant how war is waged.<br />
Yet, even thus, unvantaged and on foot,<br />
Superior honors I that day acquired<br />
To theirs who rode, for Pallas led me on<span class="lnm">870</span><br />
Herself to victory. There is a stream<br />
Which at Arena falls into the sea,<br />
Named Minu&euml;ius; on that river's bank<br />
The Pylian horsemen waited day's approach,<br />
And thither all our foot came pouring down.<span class="lnm">875</span><br />
The flood divine of Alpheus thence we reach'd<br />
At noon, all arm'd complete; there, hallow'd rites<br />
We held to Jove omnipotent, and slew<br />
A bull to sacred Alpheus, with a bull<br />
To Neptune, and a heifer of the herd<span class="lnm">880</span><br />
To Pallas; then, all marshall'd as they were,<br />
From van to rear our legions took repast,<br />
And at the river's side slept on their arms.<br />
Already the Epean host had round<br />
Begirt the city, bent to lay it waste,<span class="lnm">885</span><br />
A task which cost them, first, both blood and toil,<br />
For when the radiant sun on the green earth<br />
Had risen, with prayer to Pallas and to Jove,<br />
We gave them battle. When the Pylian host<br />
And the Epeans thus were close engaged,<span class="lnm">890</span><br />
I first a warrior slew, Mulius the brave,<br />
And seized his coursers. He the eldest-born<br />
Of King Augeias' daughters had espoused<br />
The golden Agamede; not an herb<br />
The spacious earth yields but she knew its powers,<span class="lnm">895</span><br />
Him, rushing on me, with my brazen lance<br />
<span class="pgnm">287</span><a name="page_287" id="page_287"></a>
I smote, and in the dust he fell; I leap'd<br />
Into his seat, and drove into the van.<br />
A panic seized the Epeans when they saw<br />
The leader of their horse o'erthrown, a Chief<span class="lnm">900</span><br />
Surpassing all in fight. Black as a cloud<br />
With whirlwind fraught, I drove impetuous on,<br />
Took fifty chariots, and at side of each<br />
Lay two slain warriors, with their teeth the soil<br />
Grinding, all vanquish'd by my single arm.<span class="lnm">905</span><br />
I had slain also the Molions, sons<br />
Of Actor, but the Sovereign of the deep<br />
Their own authentic Sire, in darkness dense<br />
Involving both, convey'd them safe away.<br />
Then Jove a victory of prime renown<span class="lnm">910</span><br />
Gave to the Pylians; for we chased and slew<br />
And gather'd spoil o'er all the champain spread<br />
With scatter'd shields, till we our steeds had driven<br />
To the Buprasian fields laden with corn,<br />
To the Olenian rock, and to a town<span class="lnm">915</span><br />
In fair Colona situate, and named<br />
Alesia. There it was that Pallas turn'd<br />
Our people homeward; there I left the last<br />
Of all the slain, and he was slain by me.<br />
Then drove the Achaians from Buprasium home<span class="lnm">920</span><br />
Their coursers fleet, and Jove, of Gods above,<br />
Received most praise, Nestor of men below.</p>
<p>  Such once was I. But brave Achilles shuts<br />
His virtues close, an unimparted store;<br />
Yet even he shall weep, when all the host,<span class="lnm">925</span><br />
His fellow-warriors once, shall be destroy'd.<br />
But recollect, young friend! the sage advice<br />
Which when thou earnest from Phthia to the aid<br />
Of Agamemnon, on that selfsame day<br />
Men&oelig;tius gave thee. We were present there,<span class="lnm">930</span><br />
Ulysses and myself, both in the house,<br />
And heard it all; for to the house we came<br />
Of Peleus in our journey through the land<br />
Of fertile Greece, gathering her states to war.<br />
<span class="pgnm">288</span><a name="page_288" id="page_288"></a>
We found thy noble sire Men&oelig;tius there,<span class="lnm">935</span><br />
Thee and Achilles; ancient Peleus stood<br />
To Jove the Thunderer offering in his court<br />
Thighs of an ox, and on the blazing rites<br />
Libation pouring from a cup of gold.<br />
While ye on preparation of the feast<span class="lnm">940</span><br />
Attended both, Ulysses and myself<br />
Stood in the vestibule; Achilles flew<br />
Toward us, introduced us by the hand,<br />
And, seating us, such liberal portion gave<br />
To each, as hospitality requires.<span class="lnm">945</span><br />
Our thirst, at length, and hunger both sufficed,<br />
I, foremost speaking, ask'd you to the wars,<br />
And ye were eager both, but from your sires<br />
Much admonition, ere ye went, received.<br />
Old Peleus charged Achilles to aspire<span class="lnm">950</span><br />
To highest praise, and always to excel.<br />
But thee, thy sire Men&oelig;tius thus advised.<br />
"My son! Achilles boasts the nobler birth,<br />
But thou art elder; he in strength excels<br />
Thee far; thou, therefore, with discretion rule<span class="lnm">955</span><br />
His inexperience; thy advice impart<br />
With gentleness; instruction wise suggest<br />
Wisely, and thou shalt find him apt to learn."<br />
So thee thy father taught, but, as it seems,<br />
In vain. Yet even now essay to move<span class="lnm">960</span><br />
Warlike Achilles; if the Gods so please,<br />
Who knows but that thy reasons may prevail<br />
To rouse his valiant heart? men rarely scorn<br />
The earnest intercession of a friend.<br />
But if some prophecy alarm his fears,<span class="lnm">965</span><br />
And from his Goddess mother he have aught<br />
Received, who may have learnt the same from Jove,<br />
Thee let him send at least, and order forth<br />
With thee the Myrmidons; a dawn of hope<br />
Shall thence, it may be, on our host arise.<span class="lnm">970</span><br />
And let him send thee to the battle clad<br />
In his own radiant armor; Troy, deceived<br />
<span class="pgnm">289</span><a name="page_289" id="page_289"></a>
By such resemblance, shall abstain perchance<br />
From conflict, and the weary Greeks enjoy<br />
Short respite; it is all that war allows.<span class="lnm">975</span><br />
Fresh as ye are, ye, by your shouts alone,<br />
May easily repulse an army spent<br />
With labor from the camp and from the fleet.</p>
<p>  Thus Nestor, and his mind bent to his words.<br />
Back to &AElig;acides through all the camp<span class="lnm">980</span><br />
He ran; and when, still running, he arrived<br />
Among Ulysses' barks, where they had fix'd<br />
The forum, where they minister'd the laws,<br />
And had erected altars to the Gods,<br />
There him Eurypylus, Ev&aelig;mon's son,<span class="lnm">985</span><br />
Illustrious met, deep-wounded in his thigh,<br />
And halting-back from battle. From his head<br />
The sweat, and from his shoulders ran profuse,<br />
And from his perilous wound the sable blood<br />
Continual stream'd; yet was his mind composed.<span class="lnm">990</span><br />
Him seeing, Men&oelig;tiades the brave<br />
Compassion felt, and mournful, thus began.</p>
<p>  Ah hapless senators and Chiefs of Greece!<br />
Left ye your native country that the dogs<br />
Might fatten on your flesh at distant Troy?<span class="lnm">995</span><br />
But tell me, Hero! say, Eurypylus!<br />
Have the Achaians power still to withstand<br />
The enormous force of Hector, or is this<br />
The moment when his spear must pierce us all?</p>
<p>  To whom Eurypylus, discreet, replied.<span class="lnm">1000</span><br />
Patroclus, dear to Jove! there is no help,<br />
No remedy. We perish at our ships.<br />
The warriors, once most strenuous of the Greeks,<br />
Lie wounded in the fleet by foes whose might<br />
Increases ever. But thyself afford<span class="lnm">1005</span><br />
To me some succor; lead me to my ship;<br />
Cut forth the arrow from my thigh; the gore<br />
With warm ablution cleanse, and on the wound<br />
Smooth unguents spread, the same as by report<br />
Achilles taught thee; taught, himself, their use<span class="lnm">1010</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">290</span><a name="page_290" id="page_290"></a>
By Chiron, Centaur, justest of his kind<br />
For Podalirius and Machaon both<br />
Are occupied. Machaon, as I judge,<br />
Lies wounded in his tent, needing like aid<br />
Himself, and Podalirius in the field<span class="lnm">1015</span><br />
Maintains sharp conflict with the sons of Troy.</p>
<p>  To whom Men&oelig;tius' gallant son replied.<br />
Hero! Eurypylus! how shall we act<br />
In this perplexity? what course pursue?<br />
I seek the brave Achilles, to whose ear<span class="lnm">1020</span><br />
I bear a message from the ancient chief<br />
Gerenian Nestor, guardian of the Greeks.<br />
Yet will I not, even for such a cause,<br />
My friend! abandon thee in thy distress.</p>
<p>  He ended, and his arms folding around<span class="lnm">1025</span><br />
The warrior bore him thence into his tent.<br />
His servant, on his entrance, spread the floor<br />
With hides, on which Patroclus at his length<br />
Extended him, and with his knife cut forth<br />
The rankling point; with tepid lotion, next,<span class="lnm">1030</span><br />
He cleansed the gore, and with a bitter root<br />
Bruised small between his palms, sprinkled the wound.<br />
At once, the anodyne his pain assuaged,<br />
The wound was dried within, and the blood ceased.</p>
</div>

<hr class="small" />

<p>It will be well here to observe the position of the Greeks. All human aid
is cut off by the wounds of their heroes, and all assistance from the Gods
forbidden by Jupiter. On the contrary, the Trojans see their general at their
head, and Jupiter himself fights on their side. Upon this hinge turns the
whole poem. The distress of the Greeks occasions first the assistance of
Patroclus, and then the death of that hero brings back Achilles.</p>

<p>The poet shows great skill in conducting these incidents. He gives
Achilles the pleasure of seeing that the Greeks could not carry on the war
without his assistance, and upon this depends the great catastrophe of the
poem.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="noind">So was Men&oelig;tius' gallant son employ'd<br />
Healing Eurypylus. The Greeks, meantime,<br />
And Trojans with tumultuous fury fought.<br />
Nor was the foss ordain'd long time to exclude<br />
The host of Troy, nor yet the rampart built<span class="lnm">5</span><br />
Beside it for protection of the fleet;<br />
For hecatomb the Greeks had offer'd none,<br />
Nor prayer to heaven, that it might keep secure<br />
Their ships with all their spoils. The mighty work<br />
As in defiance of the Immortal Powers<span class="lnm">10</span><br />
Had risen, and could not therefore long endure.<br />
While Hector lived, and while Achilles held<br />
His wrathful purpose; while the city yet<br />
Of royal Priam was unsack'd, so long<br />
The massy structure stood; but when the best<span class="lnm">15</span><br />
And bravest of the Trojan host were slain,<br />
And of the Grecian heroes, some had fallen<br />
And some survived, when Priam's towers had blazed<br />
In the tenth year, and to their native shores<br />
The Grecians with their ships, at length, return'd,<span class="lnm">20</span><br />
Then Neptune, with Apollo leagued, devised<br />
Its ruin; every river that descends<br />
From the Id&aelig;an heights into the sea<br />
They brought against it, gathering all their force.<br />
Rhesus, Caresus, Rhodius, the wide-branch'd<span class="lnm">25</span><br />
Heptaporus, &AElig;sepus, Granicus,<br />
<span class="pgnm">294</span><a name="page_294" id="page_294"></a>
Scamander's sacred current, and thy stream<br />
Sim&ouml;is, whose banks with helmets and with shields<br />
Were strew'd, and Chiefs of origin divine;<br />
All these with refluent course Apollo drove<span class="lnm">30</span><br />
Nine days against the rampart, and Jove rain'd<br />
Incessant, that the Grecian wall wave-whelm'd<br />
Through all its length might sudden disappear.<br />
Neptune with his tridental mace, himself,<br />
Led them, and beam and buttress to the flood<span class="lnm">35</span><br />
Consigning, laid by the laborious Greeks,<br />
Swept the foundation, and the level bank<br />
Of the swift-rolling Hellespont restored.<br />
The structure thus effaced, the spacious beach<br />
He spread with sand as at the first; then bade<span class="lnm">40</span><br />
Subside the streams, and in their channels wind<br />
With limpid course, and pleasant as before,</p>
<p>  Apollo thus and Neptune, from the first,<br />
Design'd its fall; but now the battle raved<br />
And clamors of the warriors all around<span class="lnm">45</span><br />
The strong-built turrets, whose assaulted planks<br />
Rang, while the Grecians, by the scourge of Jove<br />
Subdued, stood close within their fleet immured,<br />
At Hector's phalanx-scattering force appall'd.<br />
He, as before, with whirlwind fury fought.<span class="lnm">50</span><br />
As when the boar or lion fiery-eyed<br />
Turns short, the hunters and the hounds among,<br />
The close-embattled troop him firm oppose,<br />
And ply him fast with spears; he no dismay<br />
Conceives or terror in his noble heart,<span class="lnm">55</span><br />
But by his courage falls; frequent he turns<br />
Attempting bold the ranks, and where he points<br />
Direct his onset, there the ranks retire;<br />
So, through the concourse on his rolling wheels<br />
Borne rapid, Hector animated loud<span class="lnm">60</span><br />
His fellow-warriors to surpass the trench.<br />
But not his own swift-footed steeds would dare<br />
That hazard; standing on the dangerous brink<br />
They neigh'd aloud, for by its breadth the foss<br />
<span class="pgnm">295</span><a name="page_295" id="page_295"></a>
Deterr'd them; neither was the effort slight<span class="lnm">65</span><br />
To leap that gulf, nor easy the attempt<br />
To pass it through; steep were the banks profound<br />
On both sides, and with massy piles acute<br />
Thick-planted, interdicting all assault.<br />
No courser to the rapid chariot braced<span class="lnm">70</span><br />
Had enter'd there with ease; yet strong desires<br />
Possess'd the infantry of that emprize,<br />
And thus Polydamas the ear address'd<br />
Of dauntless Hector, standing at his side.</p>
<p>  Hector, and ye the leaders of our host,<span class="lnm">75</span><br />
Both Trojans and allies! rash the attempt<br />
I deem, and vain, to push our horses through,<br />
So dangerous is the pass; rough is the trench<br />
With pointed stakes, and the Achaian wall<br />
Meets us beyond. No chariot may descend<span class="lnm">80</span><br />
Or charioteer fight there; strait are the bounds,<br />
And incommodious, and his death were sure.<br />
If Jove, high-thundering Ruler of the skies,<br />
Will succor Ilium, and nought less intend<br />
Than utter devastation of the Greeks,<span class="lnm">85</span><br />
I am content; now perish all their host<br />
Inglorious, from their country far remote.<br />
But should they turn, and should ourselves be driven<br />
Back from the fleet impeded and perplex'd<br />
In this deep foss, I judge that not a man,<span class="lnm">90</span><br />
'Scaping the rallied Grecians, should survive<br />
To bear the tidings of our fate to Troy.<br />
Now, therefore, act we all as I advise.<br />
Let every charioteer his coursers hold<br />
Fast-rein'd beside the foss, while we on foot,<span class="lnm">95</span><br />
With order undisturb'd and arms in hand,<br />
Shall follow Hector. If destruction borne<br />
On wings of destiny this day approach<br />
The Grecians, they will fly our first assault.</p>
<p>  So spake Polydamas, whose safe advice<span class="lnm">100</span><br />
Pleased Hector; from his chariot to the ground<br />
All arm'd he leap'd, nor would a Trojan there<br />
<span class="pgnm">296</span><a name="page_296" id="page_296"></a>
(When once they saw the Hero on his feet)<br />
Ride into battle, but unanimous<br />
Descending with a leap, all trod the plain.<span class="lnm">105</span><br />
Each gave command that at the trench his steeds<br />
Should stand detain'd in orderly array;<br />
Then, suddenly, the parted host became<br />
Five bands, each following its appointed chief.<br />
The bravest and most numerous, and whose hearts<span class="lnm">110</span><br />
Wish'd most to burst the barrier and to wage<br />
The battle at the ships, with Hector march'd<br />
And with Polydamas, whom follow'd, third,<br />
Cebriones; for Hector had his steeds<br />
Consign'd and chariot to inferior care.<span class="lnm">115</span><br />
Paris, Alcatho&uuml;s, and Agenor led<br />
The second band, and, sons of Priam both,<br />
De&iuml;phobus and Helenus, the third;<br />
With them was seen partner of their command;<br />
The Hero Asius; from Arisba came<span class="lnm">120</span><br />
Asius Hyrtacides, to battle drawn<br />
From the Selle&iuml;s banks by martial steeds<br />
Hair'd fiery-red and of the noblest size.<br />
The fourth, Anchises' mighty son controll'd,<br />
&AElig;neas; under him Antenor's sons,<span class="lnm">125</span><br />
Archilochus and Acamas, advanced,<br />
Adept in all the practice of the field.<br />
Last came the glorious powers in league with Troy<br />
Led by Sarpedon; he with Glaucus shared<br />
His high control, and with the warlike Chief<span class="lnm">130</span><br />
Asterop&aelig;us; for of all his host<br />
Them bravest he esteem'd, himself except<br />
Superior in heroic might to all.<br />
And now (their shields adjusted each to each)<br />
With dauntless courage fired, right on they moved<span class="lnm">135</span><br />
Against the Grecians; nor expected less<br />
Than that beside their sable ships, the host<br />
Should self-abandon'd fall an easy prey.</p>
<p>  The Trojans, thus with their confederate powers,<br />
The counsel of the accomplish'd Prince pursued,<span class="lnm">140</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">297</span><a name="page_297" id="page_297"></a>
Polydamas, one Chief alone except,<br />
Asius Hyrtacides. He scorn'd to leave<br />
His charioteer and coursers at the trench,<br />
And drove toward the fleet. Ah, madly brave!<br />
His evil hour was come; he was ordain'd<span class="lnm">145</span><br />
With horse and chariot and triumphant shout<br />
To enter wind-swept Ilium never more.<br />
Deucalion's offspring, first, into the shades<br />
Dismiss'd him; by Idomeneus he died.<br />
Leftward he drove furious, along the road<span class="lnm">150</span><br />
By which the steeds and chariots of the Greeks<br />
Return'd from battle; in that track he flew,<br />
Nor found the portals by the massy bar<br />
Secured, but open for reception safe<br />
Of fugitives, and to a guard consign'd.<span class="lnm">155</span><br />
Thither he drove direct, and in his rear<br />
His band shrill-shouting follow'd, for they judged<br />
The Greeks no longer able to withstand<br />
Their foes, but sure to perish in the camp.<br />
Vain hope! for in the gate two Chiefs they found<span class="lnm">160</span><br />
Lapith&aelig;-born, courageous offspring each<br />
Of dauntless father; Polyp&oelig;tes, this,<br />
Sprung from Pirith&ouml;us; that, the warrior bold<br />
Leonteus, terrible as gore-tainted Mars.<br />
These two, defenders of the lofty gates,<span class="lnm">165</span><br />
Stood firm before them. As when two tall oaks<br />
On the high mountains day by day endure<br />
Rough wind and rain, by deep-descending roots<br />
Of hugest growth fast-founded in the soil;<br />
So they, sustain'd by conscious valor, saw,<span class="lnm">170</span><br />
Unmoved, high towering Asius on his way,<br />
Nor fear'd him aught, nor shrank from his approach<br />
Right on toward the barrier, lifting high<br />
Their season'd bucklers and with clamor loud<br />
The band advanced, King Asius at their head,<span class="lnm">175</span><br />
With whom I&auml;menus, expert in arms,<br />
Orestes, Th&ouml;on, Acamas the son<br />
Of Asius, and Oenom&auml;us, led them on.<br />
<span class="pgnm">298</span><a name="page_298" id="page_298"></a>
Till now, the warlike pair, exhorting loud<br />
The Grecians to defend the fleet, had stood<span class="lnm">180</span><br />
Within the gates; but soon as they perceived<br />
The Trojans swift advancing to the wall,<br />
And heard a cry from all the flying Greeks,<br />
Both sallying, before the gates they fought<br />
Like forest-boars, which hearing in the hills<span class="lnm">185</span><br />
The crash of hounds and huntsmen nigh at hand,<br />
With start oblique lay many a sapling flat<br />
Short-broken by the root, nor cease to grind<br />
Their sounding tusks, till by the spear they die;<br />
So sounded on the breasts of those brave two<span class="lnm">190</span><br />
The smitten brass; for resolute they fought,<br />
Embolden'd by their might who kept the wall,<br />
And trusting in their own; they, in defence<br />
Of camp and fleet and life, thick battery hurl'd<br />
Of stones precipitated from the towers;<span class="lnm">195</span><br />
Frequent as snows they fell, which stormy winds,<br />
Driving the gloomy clouds, shake to the ground,<br />
Till all the fertile earth lies cover'd deep.<br />
Such volley pour'd the Greeks, and such return'd<br />
The Trojans; casques of hide, arid and tough,<span class="lnm">200</span><br />
And bossy shields rattled, by such a storm<br />
Assail'd of millstone masses from above.<br />
Then Asius, son of Hyrtacus, a groan<br />
Indignant utter'd; on both thighs he smote<br />
With disappointment furious, and exclaim'd,<span class="lnm">205</span></p>
<p>  Jupiter! even thou art false become,<br />
And altogether such. Full sure I deem'd<br />
That not a Grecian hero should abide<br />
One moment force invincible as ours,<br />
And lo! as wasps ring-streaked,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_12-1">[1]</a> or bees that build<span class="lnm">210</span><br />
Their dwellings in the highway's craggy side<br />
Leave not their hollow home, but fearless wait<br />
The hunter's coming, in their brood's defence,<br />
So these, although two only, from the gates<br />
<span class="pgnm">299</span><a name="page_299" id="page_299"></a>
Move not, nor will, till either seized or slain.<span class="lnm">215</span></p>
<p>  So Asius spake, but speaking so, changed not<br />
The mind of Jove on Hector's glory bent.<br />
Others, as obstinate, at other gates<br />
Such deeds perform'd, that to enumerate all<br />
Were difficult, unless to power divine.<span class="lnm">220</span><br />
For fierce the hail of stones from end to end<br />
Smote on the barrier; anguish fill'd the Greeks.<br />
Yet, by necessity constrain'd, their ships<br />
They guarded still; nor less the Gods themselves,<br />
Patrons of Greece, all sorrow'd at the sight.<span class="lnm">225</span></p>
<p>  At once the valiant Lapith&aelig; began<br />
Terrible conflict, and Pirithous' son<br />
Brave Polyp&oelig;tes through his helmet pierced<br />
Damasus; his resplendent point the brass<br />
Sufficed not to withstand; entering, it crush'd<span class="lnm">230</span><br />
The bone within, and mingling all his brain<br />
With his own blood, his onset fierce repress'd.<br />
Pylon and Ormenus he next subdued.<br />
Meantime Leonteus, branch of Mars, his spear<br />
Hurl'd at Hippomachus, whom through his belt<span class="lnm">235</span><br />
He pierced; then drawing forth his falchion keen,<br />
Through all the multitude he flew to smite<br />
Antiphates, and with a downright stroke<br />
Fell'd him. I&auml;menus and Menon next<br />
He slew, with brave Orestes, whom he heap'd,<span class="lnm">240</span><br />
All three together, on the fertile glebe.</p>
<p>  While them the Lapith&aelig; of their bright arms<br />
Despoil'd, Polydamas and Hector stood<br />
(With all the bravest youths and most resolved<br />
To burst the barrier and to fire the fleet)<span class="lnm">245</span><br />
Beside the foss, pondering the event.<br />
For, while they press'd to pass, they spied a bird<br />
Sublime in air, an eagle. Right between<br />
Both hosts he soar'd (the Trojan on his left)<br />
A serpent bearing in his pounces clutch'd<span class="lnm">250</span><br />
Enormous, dripping blood, but lively still<br />
And mindful of revenge; for from beneath<br />
<span class="pgnm">300</span><a name="page_300" id="page_300"></a>
The eagle's breast, updarting fierce his head,<br />
Fast by the throat he struck him; anguish-sick<br />
The eagle cast him down into the space<span class="lnm">255</span><br />
Between the hosts, and, clanging loud his plumes<br />
As the wind bore him, floated far away.<br />
Shudder'd the Trojans viewing at their feet<br />
The spotted serpent ominous, and thus<br />
Polydamas to dauntless Hector spake.<span class="lnm">260</span></p>
<p>  Ofttimes in council, Hector, thou art wont<br />
To censure me, although advising well;<br />
Nor ought the private citizen, I confess,<br />
Either in council or in war to indulge<br />
Loquacity, but ever to employ<span class="lnm">265</span><br />
All his exertions in support of thine.<br />
Yet hear my best opinion once again.<br />
Proceed we not in our attempt against<br />
The Grecian fleet. For if in truth the sign<br />
Respect the host of Troy ardent to pass,<span class="lnm">270</span><br />
Then, as the eagle soar'd both hosts between,<br />
With Ilium's on his left, and clutch'd a snake<br />
Enormous, dripping blood, but still alive,<br />
Which yet he dropp'd suddenly, ere he reach'd<br />
His eyry, or could give it to his young,<span class="lnm">275</span><br />
So we, although with mighty force we burst<br />
Both gates and barrier, and although the Greeks<br />
Should all retire, shall never yet the way<br />
Tread honorably back by which we came.<br />
No. Many a Trojan shall we leave behind<span class="lnm">280</span><br />
Slain by the Grecians in their fleet's defence.<br />
An augur skill'd in omens would expound<br />
This omen thus, and faith would win from all.</p>
<p>  To whom, dark-louring, Hector thus replied.<br />
Polydamas! I like not thy advice;<span class="lnm">285</span><br />
Thou couldst have framed far better; but if this<br />
Be thy deliberate judgment, then the Gods<br />
Make thy deliberate judgment nothing worth,<br />
Who bidd'st me disregard the Thunderer's<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_12-2">[2]</a> firm<br />
<span class="pgnm">301</span><a name="page_301" id="page_301"></a>
Assurance to myself announced, and make<span class="lnm">290</span><br />
The wild inhabitants of air my guides,<br />
Which I alike despise, speed they their course<br />
With right-hand flight toward the ruddy East,<br />
Or leftward down into the shades of eve.<br />
Consider <i>we</i> the will of Jove alone,<span class="lnm">295</span><br />
Sovereign of heaven and earth. Omens abound,<br />
But the best omen is our country's cause.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_12-3">[3]</a><br />
Wherefore should fiery war <i>thy</i> soul alarm?<br />
For were we slaughter'd, one and all, around<br />
The fleet of Greece, <i>thou</i> need'st not fear to die,<span class="lnm">300</span><br />
Whose courage never will thy flight retard.<br />
But if thou shrink thyself, or by smooth speech<br />
Seduce one other from a soldier's part,<br />
Pierced by this spear incontinent thou diest.</p>
<p>  So saying he led them, who with deafening roar<span class="lnm">305</span><br />
Follow'd him. Then, from the Id&aelig;an hills<br />
Jove hurl'd a storm which wafted right the dust<br />
Into the fleet; the spirits too he quell'd<br />
Of the Achaians, and the glory gave<br />
To Hector and his host; they, trusting firm<span class="lnm">310</span><br />
In signs from Jove, and in their proper force,<br />
Assay'd the barrier; from the towers they tore<br />
The galleries, cast the battlements to ground,<br />
And the projecting buttresses adjoin'd<br />
To strengthen the vast work, with bars upheaved.<span class="lnm">315</span><br />
All these, with expectation fierce to break<br />
The rampart, down they drew; nor yet the Greeks<br />
Gave back, but fencing close with shields the wall,<br />
Smote from behind them many a foe beneath.<br />
Meantime from tower to tower the Ajaces moved<span class="lnm">320</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">302</span><a name="page_302" id="page_302"></a>
Exhorting all; with mildness some, and some<br />
With harsh rebuke, whom they observed through fear<br />
Declining base the labors of the fight,</p>
<p>  Friends! Argives! warriors of whatever rank!<br />
Ye who excel, and ye of humbler note!<span class="lnm">325</span><br />
And ye the last and least! (for such there are,<br />
All have not magnanimity alike)<br />
Now have we work for all, as all perceive.<br />
Turn not, retreat not to your ships, appall'd<br />
By sounding menaces, but press the foe;<span class="lnm">330</span><br />
Exhort each other, and e'en now perchance<br />
Olympian Jove, by whom the lightnings burn,<br />
Shall grant us to repulse them, and to chase<br />
The routed Trojans to their gates again.</p>
<p>  So they vociferating to the Greeks,<span class="lnm">335</span><br />
Stirr'd them to battle. As the feathery snows<br />
Fall frequent, on some wintry day, when Jove<br />
Hath risen to shed them on the race of man,<br />
And show his arrowy stores; he lulls the winds,<br />
Then shakes them down continual, covering thick<span class="lnm">340</span><br />
Mountain tops, promontories, flowery meads,<br />
And cultured valleys rich; the ports and shores<br />
Receive it also of the hoary deep,<br />
But there the waves bound it, while all beside<br />
Lies whelm'd beneath Jove's fast-descending shower,<span class="lnm">345</span><br />
So thick, from side to side, by Trojans hurl'd<br />
Against the Greeks, and by the Greeks return'd<br />
The stony vollies flew; resounding loud<br />
Through all its length the battered rampart roar'd.<br />
Nor yet had Hector and his host prevail'd<span class="lnm">350</span><br />
To burst the gates, and break the massy bar,<br />
Had not all-seeing Jove Sarpedon moved<br />
His son, against the Greeks, furious as falls<br />
The lion on some horned herd of beeves.<br />
At once his polish'd buckler he advanced<span class="lnm">355</span><br />
With leafy brass o'erlaid; for with smooth brass<br />
The forger of that shield its oval disk<br />
Had plated, and with thickest hides throughout<br />
<span class="pgnm">303</span><a name="page_303" id="page_303"></a>
Had lined it, stitch'd with circling wires of gold.<br />
That shield he bore before him; firmly grasp'd<span class="lnm">360</span><br />
He shook two spears, and with determined strides<br />
March'd forward. As the lion mountain-bred,<br />
After long fast, by impulse of his heart<br />
Undaunted urged, seeks resolute the flock<br />
Even in the shelter of their guarded home;<span class="lnm">365</span><br />
He finds, perchance, the shepherds arm'd with spears,<br />
And all their dogs awake, yet can not leave<br />
Untried the fence, but either leaps it light,<br />
And entering tears the prey, or in the attempt<br />
Pierced by some dexterous peasant, bleeds himself;<span class="lnm">370</span><br />
So high his courage to the assault impell'd<br />
Godlike Sarpedon, and him fired with hope<br />
To break the barrier; when to Glaucus thus,<br />
Son of Hippolochus, his speech he turn'd.</p>
<p>  Why, Glaucus, is the seat of honor ours,<span class="lnm">375</span><br />
Why drink we brimming cups, and feast in state?<br />
Why gaze they all on us as we were Gods<br />
In Lycia, and why share we pleasant fields<br />
And spacious vineyards, where the Xanthus winds?<br />
Distinguished thus in Lycia, we are call'd<span class="lnm">380</span><br />
To firmness here, and to encounter bold<br />
The burning battle, that our fair report<br />
Among the Lycians may be blazon'd thus&mdash;<br />
No dastards are the potentates who rule<br />
The bright-arm'd Lycians; on the fatted flock<span class="lnm">385</span><br />
They banquet, and they drink the richest wines;<br />
But they are also valiant, and the fight<br />
Wage dauntless in the vanward of us all.<br />
Oh Glaucus, if escaping safe the death<br />
That threats us here, we also could escape<span class="lnm">390</span><br />
Old age, and to ourselves secure a life<br />
Immortal, I would neither in the van<br />
Myself expose, nor would encourage thee<br />
To tempt the perils of the glorious field.<br />
But since a thousand messengers of fate<span class="lnm">395</span><br />
Pursue us close, and man is born to die&mdash;<br />
<span class="pgnm">304</span><a name="page_304" id="page_304"></a>
E'en let us on; the prize of glory yield,<br />
If yield we must, or wrest it from the foe.</p>
<p>  He said, nor cold refusal in return<br />
Received from Glaucus, but toward the wall<span class="lnm">400</span><br />
Their numerous Lycian host both led direct.<br />
Menestheus, son of Peteos, saw appall'd<br />
Their dread approach, for to his tower they bent;<br />
Their threatening march. An eager look he cast,<br />
On the embodied Greeks, seeking some Chief<span class="lnm">405</span><br />
Whose aid might turn the battle from his van:<br />
He saw, where never sated with exploits<br />
Of war, each Ajax fought, near whom his eye<br />
Kenn'd Teucer also, newly from his tent;<br />
But vain his efforts were with loudest call<span class="lnm">410</span><br />
To reach their ears, such was the deafening din<br />
Upsent to heaven, of shields and crested helms,<br />
And of the batter'd gates; for at each gate<br />
They thundering' stood, and urged alike at each<br />
Their fierce attempt by force to burst the bars.<span class="lnm">415</span><br />
To Ajax therefore he at once dispatch'd<br />
A herald, and Th&ouml;otes thus enjoin'd.</p>
<p>  My noble friend, Th&ouml;otes! with all speed<br />
Call either Ajax; bid them hither both;<br />
Far better so; for havoc is at hand.<span class="lnm">420</span><br />
The Lycian leaders, ever in assault<br />
Tempestuous, bend their force against this tower<br />
My station. But if also there they find<br />
Laborious conflict pressing them severe,<br />
At least let Telamonian Ajax come,<span class="lnm">425</span><br />
And Teucer with his death-dispensing bow.</p>
<p>  He spake, nor was Th&ouml;otes slow to hear;<br />
Beside the rampart of the mail-clad Greeks<br />
Rapid he flew, and, at their side arrived,<br />
To either Ajax, eager, thus began.<span class="lnm">430</span></p>
<p>  Ye leaders of the well-appointed Greeks,<br />
The son of noble Peteos calls; he begs<br />
With instant suit, that ye would share his toils,<br />
However short your stay; the aid of both<br />
<span class="pgnm">305</span><a name="page_305" id="page_305"></a>
Will serve him best, for havoc threatens there<span class="lnm">435</span><br />
The Lycian leaders, ever in assault<br />
Tempestuous, bend their force toward the tower<br />
His station. But if also here ye find<br />
Laborious conflict pressing you severe,<br />
At least let Telamonian Ajax come,<span class="lnm">440</span><br />
And Teucer with his death-dispensing bow.</p>
<p>  He spake, nor his request the towering son<br />
Of Telamon denied, but quick his speech<br />
To Ajax O&iuml;liades address'd.</p>
<p>  Ajax! abiding here, exhort ye both<span class="lnm">445</span><br />
(Heroic Lycomedes and thyself)<br />
The Greeks to battle. Thither I depart<br />
To aid our friends, which service once perform'd<br />
Duly, I will incontinent return.</p>
<p>  So saying, the Telamonian Chief withdrew<span class="lnm">450</span><br />
With whom went Teucer, son of the same sire,<br />
Pandion also, bearing Teucer's bow.<br />
Arriving at the turret given in charge<br />
To the bold Chief Menestheus, and the wall<br />
Entering, they found their friends all sharply tried.<span class="lnm">455</span><br />
Black as a storm the senators renown'd<br />
And leaders of the Lycian host assail'd<br />
Buttress and tower, while opposite the Greeks<br />
Withstood them, and the battle-shout began.<br />
First, Ajax, son of Telamon, a friend<span class="lnm">460</span><br />
And fellow-warrior of Sarpedon slew,<br />
Epicles. With a marble fragment huge<br />
That crown'd the battlement's interior side,<br />
He smote him. No man of our puny race,<br />
Although in prime of youth, had with both hands<span class="lnm">465</span><br />
That weight sustain'd; but he the cumberous mass<br />
Uplifted high, and hurl'd it on his head.<br />
It burst his helmet, and his batter'd skull<br />
Dash'd from all form. He from the lofty tower<br />
Dropp'd downright, with a diver's plunge, and died.<span class="lnm">470</span><br />
But Teucer wounded Glaucus with a shaft<br />
Son of Hippolochus; he, climbing, bared<br />
<span class="pgnm">306</span><a name="page_306" id="page_306"></a>
His arm, which Teucer, marking, from the wall<br />
Transfix'd it, and his onset fierce repress'd;<br />
For with a backward leap Glaucus withdrew<span class="lnm">475</span><br />
Sudden and silent, cautious lest the Greeks<br />
Seeing him wounded should insult his pain.<br />
Grief seized, at sight of his retiring friend,<br />
Sarpedon, who forgat not yet the fight,<br />
But piercing with his lance Alcmaon, son<span class="lnm">480</span><br />
Of Thestor, suddenly reversed the beam,<br />
Which following, Alcmaon to the earth<br />
Fell prone, with clangor of his brazen arms.<br />
Sarpedon, then, strenuous with both hands<br />
Tugg'd, and down fell the battlement entire;<span class="lnm">485</span><br />
The wall, dismantled at the summit, stood<br />
A ruin, and wide chasm was open'd through.<br />
Then Ajax him and Teucer at one time<br />
Struck both; an arrow struck from Teucer's bow<br />
The belt that cross'd his bosom, by which hung<span class="lnm">490</span><br />
His ample shield; yet lest his son should fall<br />
Among the ships, Jove turn'd the death aside.<br />
But Ajax, springing to his thrust, a spear<br />
Drove through his shield. Sarpedon at the shock<br />
With backward step short interval recoil'd,<span class="lnm">495</span><br />
But not retired, for in his bosom lived<br />
The hope of glory still, and, looking back<br />
On all his godlike Lycians, he exclaim'd,</p>
<p>  Oh Lycians! where is your heroic might?<br />
Brave as I boast myself, I feel the task<span class="lnm">500</span><br />
Arduous, through the breach made by myself<br />
To win a passage to the ships, alone.<br />
Follow me all&mdash;Most laborers, most dispatch.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_12-4">[4]</a></p>
<p>  So he; at whose sharp reprimand abash'd<br />
The embattled host to closer conflict moved,<span class="lnm">505</span><br />
Obedient to their counsellor and King.<br />
On the other side the Greeks within the wall<br />
Made firm the phalanx, seeing urgent need;<br />
<span class="pgnm">307</span><a name="page_307" id="page_307"></a>
Nor could the valiant Lycians through the breach<br />
Admittance to the Grecian fleet obtain,<span class="lnm">510</span><br />
Nor since they first approach'd it, had the Greeks<br />
With all their efforts, thrust the Lycians back.<br />
But as two claimants of one common field,<br />
Each with his rod of measurement in hand,<br />
Dispute the boundaries, litigating warm<span class="lnm">515</span><br />
Their right in some small portion of the soil,<br />
So they, divided by the barrier, struck<br />
With hostile rage the bull-hide bucklers round,<br />
And the light targets on each other's breast.<br />
Then many a wound the ruthless weapons made.<span class="lnm">520</span><br />
Pierced through the unarm'd back, if any turn'd,<br />
He died, and numerous even through the shield.<br />
The battlements from end to end with blood<br />
Of Grecians and of Trojans on both sides<br />
Were sprinkled; yet no violence could move<span class="lnm">525</span><br />
The stubborn Greeks, or turn their powers to flight.<br />
So hung the war in balance, as the scales<br />
Held by some woman scrupulously just,<br />
A spinner; wool and weight she poises nice,<br />
Hard-earning slender pittance for her babes,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_12-5">[5]</a><span class="lnm">530</span><br />
Such was the poise in which the battle hung<br />
Till Jove himself superior fame, at length,<br />
To Priam&euml;ian Hector gave, who sprang<br />
First through the wall. In lofty sounds that reach'd<br />
Their utmost ranks, he call'd on all his host.<span class="lnm">535</span></p>
<p>  Now press them, now ye Trojans steed-renown'd<br />
Rush on! break through the Grecian rampart, hurl<br />
At once devouring flames into the fleet.<br />
Such was his exhortation; they his voice<br />
All hearing, with close-order'd ranks direct<span class="lnm">540</span><br />
Bore on the barrier, and up-swarming show'd<br />
On the high battlement their glittering spears.<br />
<span class="pgnm">308</span><a name="page_308" id="page_308"></a>
But Hector seized a stone; of ample base<br />
But tapering to a point, before the gate<br />
It stood. No two men, mightiest of a land<span class="lnm">545</span><br />
(Such men as now are mighty) could with ease<br />
Have heaved it from the earth up to a wain;<br />
He swung it easily alone; so light<br />
The son of Saturn made it in his hand.<br />
As in one hand with ease the shepherd bears<span class="lnm">550</span><br />
A ram's fleece home, nor toils beneath the weight,<br />
So Hector, right toward the planks of those<br />
Majestic folding-gates, close-jointed, firm<br />
And solid, bore the stone. Two bars within<br />
Their corresponding force combined transvere<span class="lnm">555</span><br />
To guard them, and one bolt secured the bars.<br />
He stood fast by them, parting wide his feet<br />
For 'vantage sake, and smote them in the midst.<br />
He burst both hinges; inward fell the rock<br />
Ponderous, and the portals roar'd; the bars<span class="lnm">560</span><br />
Endured not, and the planks, riven by the force<br />
Of that huge mass, flew scatter'd on all sides.<br />
In leap'd the godlike Hero at the breach,<br />
Gloomy as night in aspect, but in arms<br />
All-dazzling, and he grasp'd two quivering spears.<span class="lnm">565</span><br />
Him entering with a leap the gates, no force<br />
Whate'er of opposition had repress'd,<br />
Save of the Gods alone. Fire fill'd his eyes;<br />
Turning, he bade the multitude without<br />
Ascend the rampart; they his voice obey'd;<span class="lnm">570</span><br />
Part climb'd the wall, part pour'd into the gate;<br />
The Grecians to their hollow galleys flew<br />
Scatter'd, and tumult infinite arose.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_12-6">[6]</a></p>

<h3 class="chap">ARGUMENT OF THE THIRTEENTH BOOK.</h3>

<p class="outd">Neptune engages on the part of the Grecians. The battle proceeds. Deiphobus
advances to combat, but is repulsed by Meriones, who losing his
spear, repairs to his tent for another. Teucer slays Imbrius, and Hector
Amphimachus. Neptune, under the similitude of Thoas, exhorts Idomeneus.
Idomeneus having armed himself in his tent, and going forth to
battle, meets Meriones. After discourse held with each other, Idomeneus
accommodates Meriones with a spear, and they proceed to battle. Idomeneus
slays Othryoneus, and Asius. Deiphobus assails Idomeneus, but, his
spear glancing over him, kills Hypsenor. Idomeneus slays Alcatho&uuml;s,
son-in-law of Anchises. Deiphobus and Idomeneus respectively summon
their friends to their assistance, and a contest ensues for the body
of Alcatho&uuml;s.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="noind"><a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_13-1">[1]</a>When Jove to Hector and his host had given<br />
Such entrance to the fleet, to all the woes<br />
And toils of unremitting battle there<br />
He them abandon'd, and his glorious eyes<br />
Averting, on the land look'd down remote<span class="lnm">5</span><br />
Of the horse-breeding Thracians, of the bold<br />
Close-fighting Mysian race, and where abide<br />
On milk sustain'd, and blest with length of days,<br />
The Hippemolgi,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_13-2">[2]</a> justest of mankind.<br />
No longer now on Troy his eyes he turn'd,<span class="lnm">10</span><br />
For expectation none within his breast<br />
Survived, that God or Goddess would the Greeks<br />
Approach with succor, or the Trojans more.</p>
<p>  Nor Neptune, sovereign of the boundless Deep,<br />
Look'd forth in vain; he on the summit sat<span class="lnm">15</span><br />
Of Samothracia forest-crown'd, the stir<br />
Admiring thence and tempest of the field;<br />
<span class="pgnm">312</span><a name="page_312" id="page_312"></a>
For thence appear'd all Ida, thence the towers<br />
Of lofty Ilium, and the fleet of Greece.<br />
There sitting from the deeps uprisen, he mourn'd<span class="lnm">20</span><br />
The vanquished Grecians, and resentment fierce<br />
Conceived and wrath against all-ruling Jove.<br />
Arising sudden, down the rugged steep<br />
With rapid strides he came; the mountains huge<br />
And forests under the immortal feet<span class="lnm">25</span><br />
Trembled of Ocean's Sovereign as he strode.<br />
Three strides he made, the fourth convey'd him home<br />
To &AElig;g&aelig;. At the bottom of the abyss,<br />
There stands magnificent his golden fane,<br />
A dazzling, incorruptible abode.<span class="lnm">30</span><br />
Arrived, he to his chariot join'd his steeds<br />
Swift, brazen-hoof'd, and maned with wavy gold;<br />
Himself attiring next in gold, he seized<br />
His golden scourge, and to his seat sublime<br />
Ascending, o'er the billows drove; the whales<span class="lnm">35</span><br />
Leaving their caverns, gambol'd on all sides<br />
Around him, not unconscious of their King;<br />
He swept the surge that tinged not as he pass'd<br />
His axle, and the sea parted for joy.<br />
His bounding coursers to the Grecian fleet<span class="lnm">40</span><br />
Convey'd him swift. There is a spacious cave<br />
Deep in the bottom of the flood, the rocks<br />
Of Imbrus rude and Tenedos between;<br />
There Neptune, Shaker of the Shores, his steeds<br />
Station'd secure; he loosed them from the yoke,<span class="lnm">45</span><br />
Gave them ambrosial food, and bound their feet<br />
With golden tethers not to be untied<br />
Or broken, that unwandering they might wait<br />
Their Lord's return, then sought the Grecian host.<br />
The Trojans, tempest-like or like a flame,<span class="lnm">50</span><br />
Now, following Priame&iuml;an Hector, all<br />
Came furious on and shouting to the skies.<br />
Their hope was to possess the fleet, and leave<br />
Not an Achaian of the host unslain.<br />
But earth-encircler Neptune from the gulf<span class="lnm">55</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">313</span><a name="page_313" id="page_313"></a>
Emerging, in the form and with the voice<br />
Loud-toned of Calchas, roused the Argive ranks<br />
To battle&mdash;and his exhortation first<br />
To either Ajax turn'd, themselves prepared.</p>
<p>  Ye heroes Ajax! your accustomed force<span class="lnm">60</span><br />
Exert, oh! think not of disastrous flight,<br />
And ye shall save the people. Nought I fear<br />
Fatal elsewhere, although Troy's haughty sons<br />
Have pass'd the barrier with so fierce a throng<br />
Tumultuous; for the Grecians brazen-greaved<span class="lnm">65</span><br />
Will check them there. Here only I expect<br />
And with much dread some dire event forebode,<br />
Where Hector, terrible as fire, and loud<br />
Vaunting his glorious origin from Jove,<br />
Leads on the Trojans. Oh that from on high<span class="lnm">70</span><br />
Some God would form the purpose in your hearts<br />
To stand yourselves firmly, and to exhort<br />
The rest to stand! so should ye chase him hence<br />
All ardent as he is, and even although<br />
Olympian Jove himself his rage inspire.<span class="lnm">75</span></p>
<p>  So Neptune spake, compasser of the earth,<br />
And, with his sceptre smiting both, their hearts<br />
Fill'd with fresh fortitude; their limbs the touch<br />
Made agile, wing'd their feet and nerved their arms.<br />
Then, swift as stoops a falcon from the point<span class="lnm">80</span><br />
Of some rude rock sublime, when he would chase<br />
A fowl of other wing along the meads,<br />
So started Neptune thence, and disappear'd.<br />
Him, as he went, swift O&iuml;liades<br />
First recognized, and, instant, thus his speech<span class="lnm">85</span><br />
To Ajax, son of Telamon, address'd.</p>
<p>  Since, Ajax, some inhabitant of heaven<br />
Exhorts us, in the prophet's form to fight<br />
(For prophet none or augur we have seen;<br />
This was not Calchas; as he went I mark'd<span class="lnm">90</span><br />
His steps and knew him; Gods are known with ease)<br />
I feel my spirit in my bosom fired<br />
Afresh for battle; lightness in my limbs,<br />
<span class="pgnm">314</span><a name="page_314" id="page_314"></a>
In hands and feet a glow unfelt before.</p>
<p>  To whom the son of Telamon replied.<span class="lnm">95</span><br />
I also with invigorated hands<br />
More firmly grasp my spear; my courage mounts,<br />
A buoyant animation in my feet<br />
Bears me along, and I am all on fire<br />
To cope with Priam's furious son, alone.<span class="lnm">100</span></p>
<p>  Thus they, with martial transport to their souls<br />
Imparted by the God, conferr'd elate.<br />
Meantime the King of Ocean roused the Greeks,<br />
Who in the rear, beside their gallant barks<br />
Some respite sought. They, spent with arduous toil,<span class="lnm">105</span><br />
Felt not alone their weary limbs unapt<br />
To battle, but their hearts with grief oppress'd,<br />
Seeing the numerous multitude of Troy<br />
Within the mighty barrier; sad they view'd<br />
That sight, and bathed their cheeks with many a tear,<span class="lnm">110</span><br />
Despairing of escape. But Ocean's Lord<br />
Entering among them, soon the spirit stirr'd<br />
Of every valiant phalanx to the fight.<br />
Teucer and Le&iuml;tus, and famed in arms<br />
Peneleus, Thoas and Deipyrus,<span class="lnm">115</span><br />
Meriones, and his compeer renown'd,<br />
Antilochus; all these in accents wing'd<br />
With fierce alacrity the God address'd.</p>
<p>  Oh shame, ye Grecians! vigorous as ye are<br />
And in life's prime, to your exertions most<span class="lnm">120</span><br />
I trusted for the safety of our ships.<br />
If <i>ye</i> renounce the labors of the field,<br />
Then hath the day arisen of our defeat<br />
And final ruin by the powers of Troy.<br />
Oh! I behold a prodigy, a sight<span class="lnm">125</span><br />
Tremendous, deem'd impossible by me,<br />
The Trojans at our ships! the dastard race<br />
Fled once like fleetest hinds the destined prey<br />
Of lynxes, leopards, wolves; feeble and slight<br />
And of a nature indisposed to war<span class="lnm">130</span><br />
They rove uncertain; so the Trojans erst<br />
<span class="pgnm">315</span><a name="page_315" id="page_315"></a>
Stood not, nor to Achaian prowess dared<br />
The hindrance of a moment's strife oppose.<br />
But now, Troy left afar, even at our ships<br />
They give us battle, through our leader's fault<span class="lnm">135</span><br />
And through the people's negligence, who fill'd<br />
With fierce displeasure against <i>him</i>, prefer<br />
Death at their ships, to war in their defence.<br />
But if the son of Atreus, our supreme,<br />
If Agamemnon, have indeed transgress'd<span class="lnm">140</span><br />
Past all excuse, dishonoring the swift<br />
Achilles, ye at least the fight decline<br />
Blame-worthy, and with no sufficient plea.<br />
But heal we speedily the breach; brave minds<br />
Easily coalesce. It is not well<span class="lnm">145</span><br />
That thus your fury slumbers, for the host<br />
Hath none illustrious as yourselves in arms.<br />
I can excuse the timid if he shrink,<br />
But am incensed at <i>you</i>. My friends, beware!<br />
Your tardiness will prove ere long the cause<span class="lnm">150</span><br />
Of some worse evil. Let the dread of shame<br />
Affect your hearts; oh tremble at the thought<br />
Of infamy! Fierce conflict hath arisen;<br />
Loud shouting Hector combats at the ships<br />
Nobly, hath forced the gates and burst the bar.<span class="lnm">155</span></p>
<p>  With such encouragement those Grecian chiefs<br />
The King of Ocean roused. Then, circled soon<br />
By many a phalanx either Ajax stood,<br />
Whose order Mars himself arriving there<br />
Had praised, or Pallas, patroness of arms.<span class="lnm">160</span><br />
For there the flower of all expected firm<br />
Bold Hector and his host; spear crowded spear,<br />
Shield, helmet, man, press'd helmet, man and shield;<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_13-3">[3]</a><br />
The hairy crests of their resplendent casques<br />
Kiss'd close at every nod, so wedged they stood;<span class="lnm">165</span><br />
No spear was seen but in the manly grasp<br />
It quiver'd, and their every wish was war.<br />
The powers of Ilium gave the first assault<br />
<span class="pgnm">316</span><a name="page_316" id="page_316"></a>
Embattled close; them Hector led himself<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_13-4">[4]</a><br />
Right on, impetuous as a rolling rock<span class="lnm">170</span><br />
Destructive; torn by torrent waters off<br />
From its old lodgment on the mountain's brow,<br />
It bounds, it shoots away; the crashing wood<br />
Falls under it; impediment or check<br />
None stays its fury, till the level found,<span class="lnm">175</span><br />
There, settling by degrees, it rolls no more;<br />
So after many a threat that he would pass<br />
Easily through the Grecian camp and fleet<br />
And slay to the sea-brink, when Hector once<br />
Had fallen on those firm ranks, standing, he bore<span class="lnm">180</span><br />
Vehement on them; but by many a spear<br />
Urged and bright falchion, soon, reeling, retired,<br />
And call'd vociferous on the host of Troy.</p>
<p>  Trojans, and Lycians, and close-fighting sons<br />
Of Dardanus, oh stand! not long the Greeks<span class="lnm">185</span><br />
Will me confront, although embodied close<br />
In solid phalanx; doubt it not; my spear<br />
Shall chase and scatter them, if Jove, in truth,<br />
High-thundering mate of Juno, bid me on.</p>
<p>  So saying he roused the courage of them all<span class="lnm">190</span><br />
Foremost of whom advanced, of Priam's race<br />
Deiphobus, ambitious of renown.<br />
Tripping he came with shorten'd steps,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_13-5">[5]</a> his feet<br />
Sheltering behind his buckler; but at him<br />
Aiming, Meriones his splendid lance<span class="lnm">195</span><br />
Dismiss'd, nor err'd; his bull-hide targe he struck<br />
But ineffectual; where the hollow wood<br />
Receives the inserted brass, the quivering beam<br />
Snapp'd; then, Deiphobus his shield afar<br />
Advanced before him, trembling at a spear<span class="lnm">200</span><br />
Hurl'd by Meriones. He, moved alike<br />
With indignation for the victory lost<br />
And for his broken spear, into his band<br />
<span class="pgnm">317</span><a name="page_317" id="page_317"></a>
At first retired, but soon set forth again<br />
In prowess through the Achaian camp, to fetch<span class="lnm">205</span><br />
Its fellow-spear within his tent reserved.</p>
<p>  The rest all fought, and dread the shouts arose<br />
On all sides. Telamonian Teucer, first,<br />
Slew valiant Imbrius, son of Mentor, rich<br />
In herds of sprightly steeds. He ere the Greeks<span class="lnm">210</span><br />
Arrived at Ilium, in Ped&aelig;us dwelt,<br />
And Priam's spurious daughter had espoused<br />
Medesicasta. But the barks well-oar'd<br />
Of Greece arriving, he return'd to Troy,<br />
Where he excell'd the noblest, and abode<span class="lnm">215</span><br />
With Priam, loved and honor'd as his own.<br />
Him Teucer pierced beneath his ear, and pluck'd<br />
His weapon home; he fell as falls an ash<br />
Which on some mountain visible afar,<br />
Hewn from its bottom by the woodman's axe,<span class="lnm">220</span><br />
With all its tender foliage meets the ground<br />
So Imbrius fell; loud rang his armor bright<br />
With ornamental brass, and Teucer flew<br />
To seize his arms, whom hasting to the spoil<br />
Hector with his resplendent spear assail'd;<span class="lnm">225</span><br />
He, marking opposite its rapid flight,<br />
Declined it narrowly and it pierced the breast,<br />
As he advanced to battle, of the son<br />
Of Cteatus of the Actorian race,<br />
Amphimachus; he, sounding, smote the plain,<span class="lnm">230</span><br />
And all his batter'd armor rang aloud.<br />
Then Hector swift approaching, would have torn<br />
The well-forged helmet from the brows away<br />
Of brave Amphimachus; but Ajax hurl'd<br />
Right forth at Hector hasting to the spoil<span class="lnm">235</span><br />
His radiant spear; no wound the spear impress'd,<br />
For he was arm'd complete in burnish'd brass<br />
Terrific; but the solid boss it pierced<br />
Of Hector's shield, and with enormous force<br />
So shock'd him, that retiring he resign'd<span class="lnm">240</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">318</span><a name="page_318" id="page_318"></a>
Both bodies,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_13-6">[6]</a> which the Grecians dragg'd away.<br />
Stichius and Menestheus, leaders both<br />
Of the Athenians, to the host of Greece<br />
Bore off Amphimachus, and, fierce in arms<br />
The Ajaces, Imbrius. As two lions bear<span class="lnm">245</span><br />
Through thick entanglement of boughs and brakes<br />
A goat snatch'd newly from the peasants' cogs,<br />
Upholding high their prey above the ground,<br />
So either Ajax terrible in fight,<br />
Upholding Imbrius high, his brazen arms<span class="lnm">250</span><br />
Tore off, and O&iuml;liades his head<br />
From his smooth neck dissevering in revenge<br />
For slain Amphimachus, through all the host<br />
Sent it with swift rotation like a globe,<br />
Till in the dust at Hector's feet it fell.<span class="lnm">255</span></p>
<p>  Then anger fill'd the heart of Ocean's King,<br />
His grandson<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_13-7">[7]</a> slain in battle; forth he pass'd<br />
Through the Achaian camp and fleet, the Greeks<br />
Rousing, and meditating wo to Troy.<br />
It chanced that brave Idomeneus return'd<span class="lnm">260</span><br />
That moment from a Cretan at the knee<br />
Wounded, and newly borne into his tent;<br />
His friends had borne him off, and when the Chief<br />
Had given him into skilful hands, he sought<br />
The field again, still coveting renown.<span class="lnm">265</span><br />
Him therefore, meeting him on his return,<br />
Neptune bespake, but with the borrow'd voice<br />
Of Thoas, offspring of Andr&aelig;mon, King<br />
In Pleuro and in lofty Calydon,<br />
And honor'd by the &AElig;tolians as a God.<span class="lnm">270</span></p>
<p>  Oh counsellor of Crete! our threats denounced<br />
Against the towers of Troy, where are they now?</p>
<p>  To whom the leader of the Cretans, thus,<br />
Idomeneus. For aught that I perceive<br />
Thoas! no Grecian is this day in fault!<span class="lnm">275</span><br />
For we are all intelligent in arms,<br />
<span class="pgnm">319</span><a name="page_319" id="page_319"></a>
None yields by fear oppress'd, none lull'd by sloth<br />
From battle shrinks; but such the pleasure seems<br />
Of Jove himself, that we should perish here<br />
Inglorious, from our country far remote<span class="lnm">280</span><br />
But, Thoas! (for thine heart was ever firm<br />
In battle, and thyself art wont to rouse<br />
Whom thou observ'st remiss) now also fight<br />
As erst, and urge each leader of the host.</p>
<p>  Him answered, then, the Sovereign of the Deep.<span class="lnm">285</span><br />
Return that Grecian never from the shores<br />
Of Troy, Idomeneus! but may the dogs<br />
Feast on him, who shall this day intermit<br />
Through wilful negligence his force in fight!<br />
But haste, take arms and come; we must exert<span class="lnm">290</span><br />
All diligence, that, being only two,<br />
We yet may yield some service. Union much<br />
Emboldens even the weakest, and our might<br />
Hath oft been proved on warriors of renown.</p>
<p>  So Neptune spake, and, turning, sought again<span class="lnm">295</span><br />
The toilsome field. Ere long, Idomeneus<br />
Arriving in his spacious tent, put on<br />
His radiant armor, and, two spears in hand,<br />
Set forth like lightning which Saturnian Jove<br />
From bright Olympus shakes into the air,<span class="lnm">300</span><br />
A sign to mortal men, dazzling all eyes;<br />
So beam'd the Hero's armor as he ran.<br />
But him not yet far distant from his tent<br />
Meriones, his fellow-warrior met,<br />
For he had left the fight, seeking a spear,<span class="lnm">305</span><br />
When thus the brave Idomeneus began.</p>
<p>  Swift son of Molus! chosen companion dear!<br />
Wherefore, Meriones, hast thou the field<br />
Abandon'd? Art thou wounded? Bring'st thou home<br />
Some pointed mischief in thy flesh infixt?<span class="lnm">310</span><br />
Or comest thou sent to me, who of myself<br />
The still tent covet not, but feats of arms?</p>
<p>  To whom Meriones discreet replied,<br />
Chief leader of the Cretans, brazen-mail'd<br />
<span class="pgnm">320</span><a name="page_320" id="page_320"></a>
Idomeneus! if yet there be a spear<span class="lnm">315</span><br />
Left in thy tent, I seek one; for I broke<br />
The spear, even now, with which erewhile I fought,<br />
Smiting the shield of fierce Deiphobus.</p>
<p>  Then answer thus the Cretan Chief return'd,<br />
Valiant Idomeneus. If spears thou need,<span class="lnm">320</span><br />
Within my tent, leaning against the wall,<br />
Stand twenty spears and one, forged all in Troy,<br />
Which from the slain I took; for distant fight<br />
Me suits not; therefore in my tent have I<br />
Both spears and bossy shields, with brazen casques<span class="lnm">325</span><br />
And corselets bright that smile against the sun.</p>
<p>  Him answer'd, then, Meriones discreet.<br />
I also, at my tent and in my ship<br />
Have many Trojan spoils, but they are hence<br />
Far distant. I not less myself than thou<span class="lnm">330</span><br />
Am ever mindful of a warrior's part,<br />
And when the din of glorious arms is heard,<br />
Fight in the van. If other Greeks my deeds<br />
Know not, at least I judge them known to thee.</p>
<p>  To whom the leader of the host of Crete<span class="lnm">335</span><br />
Idomeneus. I know thy valor well,<br />
Why speakest thus to me? Choose we this day<br />
An ambush forth of all the bravest Greeks,<br />
(For in the ambush is distinguish'd best<br />
The courage; there the timorous and the bold<span class="lnm">340</span><br />
Plainly appear; the dastard changes hue<br />
And shifts from place to place, nor can he calm<br />
The fears that shake his trembling limbs, but sits<br />
Low-crouching on his hams, while in his breast<br />
Quick palpitates his death-foreboding heart,<span class="lnm">345</span><br />
And his teeth chatter; but the valiant man<br />
His posture shifts not; no excessive fears<br />
Feels he, but seated once in ambush, deems<br />
Time tedious till the bloody fight begin;)<br />
Even there, thy courage should no blame incur.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_13-8">[8]</a><span class="lnm">350</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">321</span><a name="page_321" id="page_321"></a>
For should'st thou, toiling in the fight, by spear<br />
Or falchion bleed, not on thy neck behind<br />
Would fall the weapon, or thy back annoy,<br />
But it would meet thy bowels or thy chest<br />
While thou didst rush into the clamorous van.<span class="lnm">355</span><br />
But haste&mdash;we may not longer loiter here<br />
As children prating, lest some sharp rebuke<br />
Reward us. Enter quick, and from within<br />
My tent provide thee with a noble spear.</p>
<p>  Then, swift as Mars, Meriones produced<span class="lnm">360</span><br />
A brazen spear of those within the tent<br />
Reserved, and kindling with heroic fire<br />
Follow'd Idomeneus. As gory Mars<br />
By Terror follow'd, his own dauntless son<br />
Who quells the boldest heart, to battle moves;<span class="lnm">365</span><br />
From Thrace against the Ephyri they arm,<br />
Or hardy Phlegyans, and by both invoked,<br />
Hear and grant victory to which they please;<br />
Such, bright in arms Meriones, and such<br />
Idomeneus advanced, when foremost thus<span class="lnm">370</span><br />
Meriones his fellow-chief bespake.</p>
<p>  Son of Deucalion! where inclinest thou most<br />
To enter into battle? On the right<br />
Of all the host? or through the central ranks?<br />
Or on the left? for nowhere I account<span class="lnm">375</span><br />
The Greeks so destitute of force as there.</p>
<p>  Then answer thus Idomeneus return'd<br />
Chief of the Cretans. Others stand to guard<br />
The middle fleet; there either Ajax wars,<br />
And Teucer, noblest archer of the Greeks,<span class="lnm">380</span><br />
Nor less in stationary fight approved.<br />
Bent as he is on battle, they will task<br />
And urge to proof sufficiently the force<br />
Of Priame&iuml;an Hector; burn his rage<br />
How fierce soever, he shall find it hard,<span class="lnm">385</span><br />
With all his thirst of victory, to quell<br />
Their firm resistance, and to fire the fleet,<br />
Let not Saturnian Jove cast down from heaven<br />
<span class="pgnm">322</span><a name="page_322" id="page_322"></a>
Himself a flaming brand into the ships.<br />
High towering Telamonian Ajax yields<span class="lnm">390</span><br />
To no mere mortal by the common gift<br />
Sustain'd of Ceres, and whose flesh the spear<br />
Can penetrate, or rocky fragment bruise;<br />
In standing fight Ajax would not retire<br />
Even before that breaker of the ranks<span class="lnm">395</span><br />
Achilles, although far less swift than he.<br />
But turn we to the left, that we may learn<br />
At once, if glorious death, or life be ours.</p>
<p>  Then, rapid as the God of war, his course<br />
Meriones toward the left began,<span class="lnm">400</span><br />
As he enjoin'd. Soon as the Trojans saw<br />
Idomeneus advancing like a flame,<br />
And his compeer Meriones in arms<br />
All-radiant clad, encouraging aloud<br />
From rank to rank each other, on they came<span class="lnm">405</span><br />
To the assault combined. Then soon arose<br />
Sharp contest on the left of all the fleet.<br />
As when shrill winds blow vehement, what time<br />
Dust deepest spreads the ways, by warring blasts<br />
Upborne a sable cloud stands in the air,<span class="lnm">410</span><br />
Such was the sudden conflict; equal rage<br />
To stain with gore the lance ruled every breast.<br />
Horrent with quivering spears the fatal field<br />
Frown'd on all sides; the brazen flashes dread<br />
Of numerous helmets, corselets furbish'd bright,<span class="lnm">415</span><br />
And shields refulgent meeting, dull'd the eye,<br />
And turn'd it dark away. Stranger indeed<br />
Were he to fear, who could that strife have view'd<br />
With heart elate, or spirit unperturb'd.</p>
<p>  Two mighty sons of Saturn adverse parts<span class="lnm">420</span><br />
Took in that contest, purposing alike<br />
To many a valiant Chief sorrow and pain.<br />
Jove, for the honor of Achilles, gave<br />
Success to Hector and the host of Troy,<br />
Not for complete destruction of the Greeks<span class="lnm">425</span><br />
At Ilium, but that glory might redound<br />
<span class="pgnm">323</span><a name="page_323" id="page_323"></a>
To Thetis thence, and to her dauntless son.<br />
On the other side, the King of Ocean risen<br />
Secretly from the hoary Deep, the host<br />
Of Greece encouraged, whom he grieved to see<span class="lnm">430</span><br />
Vanquish'd by Trojans, and with anger fierce<br />
Against the Thunderer burn'd on their behalf.<br />
Alike from one great origin divine<br />
Sprang they, but Jove was elder, and surpass'd<br />
In various knowledge; therefore when he roused<span class="lnm">435</span><br />
Their courage, Neptune traversed still the ranks<br />
Clandestine, and in human form disguised.<br />
Thus, these Immortal Two, straining the cord<br />
Indissoluble of all-wasting war,<br />
Alternate measured with it either host,<span class="lnm">440</span><br />
And loosed the joints of many a warrior bold.<br />
Then, loud exhorting (though himself with age<br />
Half grey) the Achaians, into battle sprang<br />
Idomeneus, and scatter'd, first, the foe,<br />
Slaying Othryoneus, who, by the lure<span class="lnm">445</span><br />
Of martial glory drawn, had left of late<br />
Cabesus. He Priam's fair daughter woo'd<br />
Cassandra, but no nuptial gift vouchsafed<br />
To offer, save a sounding promise proud<br />
To chase, himself, however resolute<span class="lnm">450</span><br />
The Grecian host, and to deliver Troy.<br />
To him assenting, Priam, ancient King,<br />
Assured to him his wish, and in the faith<br />
Of that assurance confident, he fought.<br />
But brave Idomeneus his splendid lance<span class="lnm">455</span><br />
Well-aim'd dismissing, struck the haughty Chief.<br />
Pacing elate the field; his brazen mail<br />
Endured not; through his bowels pierced, with clang<br />
Of all his arms he fell, and thus with joy<br />
Immense exulting, spake Idomeneus.<span class="lnm">460</span></p>
<p>  I give thee praise, Othryoneus! beyond<br />
All mortal men, if truly thou perform<br />
Thy whole big promise to the Dardan king,<br />
Who promised thee his daughter. Now, behold,<br />
<span class="pgnm">324</span><a name="page_324" id="page_324"></a>
We also promise: doubt not the effect.<span class="lnm">465</span><br />
We give into thy arms the most admired<br />
Of Agamemnon's daughters, whom ourselves<br />
Will hither bring from Argos, if thy force<br />
With ours uniting, thou wilt rase the walls<br />
Of populous Troy. Come&mdash;follow me; that here<span class="lnm">470</span><br />
Among the ships we may adjust the terms<br />
Of marriage, for we take not scanty dower.</p>
<p>  So saying, the Hero dragg'd him by his heel<br />
Through all the furious fight. His death to avenge<br />
Asius on foot before his steeds advanced,<span class="lnm">475</span><br />
For them, where'er he moved, his charioteer<br />
Kept breathing ever on his neck behind.<br />
With fierce desire the heart of Asius burn'd<br />
To smite Idomeneus, who with his lance<br />
Him reaching first, pierced him beneath the chin<span class="lnm">480</span><br />
Into his throat, and urged the weapon through.<br />
He fell, as some green poplar falls, or oak,<br />
Or lofty pine, by naval artists hewn<br />
With new-edged axes on the mountain's side.<br />
So, his teeth grinding, and the bloody dust<span class="lnm">485</span><br />
Clenching, before his chariot and his steeds<br />
Extended, Asius lay. His charioteer<br />
(All recollection lost) sat panic-stunn'd,<br />
Nor dared for safety turn his steeds to flight.<br />
Him bold Antilochus right through the waist<span class="lnm">490</span><br />
Transpierced; his mail sufficed not, but the spear<br />
Implanted in his midmost bowels stood.<br />
Down from his seat magnificent he fell<br />
Panting, and young Antilochus the steeds<br />
Drove captive thence into the host of Greece.<span class="lnm">495</span><br />
Then came Deiphobus by sorrow urged<br />
For Asius, and, small interval between,<br />
Hurl'd at Idomeneus his glittering lance;<br />
But he, foreseeing its approach, the point<br />
Eluded, cover'd whole by his round shield<span class="lnm">500</span><br />
Of hides and brass by double belt sustain'd,<br />
And it flew over him, but on his targe<br />
<span class="pgnm">325</span><a name="page_325" id="page_325"></a>
Glancing, elicited a tinkling sound.<br />
Yet left it not in vain his vigorous grasp,<br />
But pierced the liver of Hypsenor, son<span class="lnm">505</span><br />
Of Hippasus; he fell incontinent,<br />
And measureless exulting in his fall<br />
Deiphobus with mighty voice exclaim'd.</p>
<p>  Not unavenged lies Asius; though he seek<br />
Hell's iron portals, yet shall he rejoice,<span class="lnm">510</span><br />
For I have given him a conductor home.</p>
<p>  So he, whose vaunt the Greeks indignant heard!<br />
But of them all to anger most he roused<br />
Antilochus, who yet his breathless friend<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_13-9">[9]</a><br />
Left not, but hasting, fenced him with his shield,<span class="lnm">515</span><br />
And brave Alastor with Mecisteus son<br />
Of Echius, bore him to the hollow ships<br />
Deep-groaning both, for of their band was he.<br />
Nor yet Idomeneus his warlike rage<br />
Remitted aught, but persevering strove<span class="lnm">520</span><br />
Either to plunge some Trojan in the shades,<br />
Or fall himself, guarding the fleet of Greece.<br />
Then slew he brave Alcatho&uuml;s the son<br />
Of &AElig;syeta, and the son-in-law<br />
Of old Anchises, who to him had given<span class="lnm">525</span><br />
The eldest-born of all his daughters fair,<br />
Hippodamia; dearly loved was she<br />
By both her parents in her virgin state,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_13-10">[10]</a><br />
For that in beauty she surpass'd, in works<br />
Ingenious, and in faculties of mind<span class="lnm">530</span><br />
All her co&euml;vals; wherefore she was deem'd<br />
Well worthy of the noblest prince of Troy.<br />
Him in that moment, Neptune by the arm<br />
Quell'd of Idomeneus, his radiant eyes<br />
Dimming, and fettering his proportion'd limbs.<span class="lnm">535</span><br />
All power of flight or to elude the stroke<br />
<span class="pgnm">326</span><a name="page_326" id="page_326"></a>
Forsook him, and while motionless he stood<br />
As stands a pillar tall or towering oak,<br />
The hero of the Cretans with a spear<br />
Transfix'd his middle chest. He split the mail<span class="lnm">540</span><br />
Erewhile his bosom's faithful guard; shrill rang<br />
The shiver'd brass; sounding he fell; the beam<br />
Implanted in his palpitating heart<br />
Shook to its topmost point, but, its force spent,<br />
At last, quiescent, stood. Then loud exclaim'd<span class="lnm">545</span><br />
Idomeneus, exulting in his fall.</p>
<p>  What thinks Deiphobus? seems it to thee<br />
Vain boaster, that, three warriors slain for one,<br />
We yield thee just amends? else, stand thyself<br />
Against me; learn the valor of a Chief<span class="lnm">550</span><br />
The progeny of Jove; Jove first begat<br />
Crete's guardian, Minos, from which Minos sprang<br />
Deucalion, and from famed Deucalion, I;<br />
I, sovereign of the numerous race of Crete's<br />
Extensive isle, and whom my galleys brought<span class="lnm">555</span><br />
To these your shores at last, that I might prove<br />
Thy curse, thy father's, and a curse to Troy.</p>
<p>  He spake; Deiphobus uncertain stood<br />
Whether, retreating, to engage the help<br />
Of some heroic Trojan, or himself<span class="lnm">560</span><br />
To make the dread experiment alone.<br />
At length, as his discreeter course, he chose<br />
To seek &AElig;neas; him he found afar<br />
Station'd, remotest of the host of Troy,<br />
For he resented evermore his worth<span class="lnm">565</span><br />
By Priam<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_13-11">[11]</a> recompensed with cold neglect.<br />
Approaching him, in accents wing'd he said.</p>
<p>  &AElig;neas! Trojan Chief! If e'er thou lov'dst<br />
Thy sister's husband, duty calls thee now<br />
To prove it. Haste&mdash;defend with me the dead<span class="lnm">570</span><br />
Alcatho&uuml;s, guardian of thy tender years,<br />
<span class="pgnm">327</span><a name="page_327" id="page_327"></a>
Slain by Idomeneus the spear-renown'd.</p>
<p>  So saying, he roused his spirit, and on fire<br />
To combat with the Cretan, forth he sprang.<br />
But fear seized not Idomeneus as fear<span class="lnm">575</span><br />
May seize a nursling boy; resolved he stood<br />
As in the mountains, conscious of his force,<br />
The wild boar waits a coming multitude<br />
Of boisterous hunters to his lone retreat;<br />
Arching his bristly spine he stands, his eyes<span class="lnm">580</span><br />
Beam fire, and whetting his bright tusks, he burns<br />
To drive, not dogs alone, but men to flight;<br />
So stood the royal Cretan, and fled not,<br />
Expecting brave &AElig;neas; yet his friends<br />
He summon'd, on Ascalaphus his eyes<span class="lnm">585</span><br />
Fastening, on Aphareus, Deipyrus,<br />
Meriones, and Antilochus, all bold<br />
In battle, and in accents wing'd exclaim'd.</p>
<p>  Haste ye, my friends! to aid me, for I stand<br />
Alone, nor undismay'd the coming wait<span class="lnm">590</span><br />
Of swift &AElig;neas, nor less brave than swift,<br />
And who possesses fresh his flower of youth,<br />
Man's prime advantage; were we match'd in years<br />
As in our spirits, either he should earn<br />
At once the meed of deathless fame, or I.<span class="lnm">595</span></p>
<p>  He said; they all unanimous approach'd,<br />
Sloping their shields, and stood. On the other side<br />
His aids &AElig;neas call'd, with eyes toward<br />
Paris, Deiphobus, Agenor, turn'd,<br />
His fellow-warriors bold; them follow'd all<span class="lnm">600</span><br />
Their people as the pastured flock the ram<br />
To water, by the shepherd seen with joy;<br />
Such joy &AElig;neas felt, seeing, so soon,<br />
That numerous host attendant at his call.<br />
Then, for Alcatho&uuml;s, into contest close<span class="lnm">605</span><br />
Arm'd with long spears they rush'd; on every breast<br />
Dread rang the brazen corselet, each his foe<br />
Assailing opposite; but two, the rest<br />
Surpassing far, terrible both as Mars,<br />
<span class="pgnm">328</span><a name="page_328" id="page_328"></a>
&AElig;neas and Idomeneus, alike<span class="lnm">610</span><br />
Panted to pierce each other with the spear.<br />
&AElig;neas, first, cast at Idomeneus,<br />
But, warn'd, he shunn'd the weapon, and it pass'd.<br />
Quivering in the soil &AElig;neas' lance<br />
Stood, hurl'd in vain, though by a forceful arm.<span class="lnm">615</span><br />
Not so the Cretan; at his waist he pierced<br />
Oenoma&uuml;s, his hollow corselet clave,<br />
And in his midmost bowels drench'd the spear;<br />
Down fell the Chief, and dying, clench'd the dust.<br />
Instant, his massy spear the King of Crete<span class="lnm">620</span><br />
Pluck'd from the dead, but of his radiant arms<br />
Despoil'd him not, by numerous weapons urged;<br />
For now, time-worn, he could no longer make<br />
Brisk sally, spring to follow his own spear,<br />
Or shun another, or by swift retreat<span class="lnm">625</span><br />
Vanish from battle, but the evil day<br />
Warded in stationary fight alone.<br />
At him retiring, therefore, step by step<br />
Deiphobus, who had with bitterest hate<br />
Long time pursued him, hurl'd his splendid lance,<span class="lnm">630</span><br />
But yet again erroneous, for he pierced<br />
Ascalaphus instead, offspring of Mars;<br />
Right through his shoulder flew the spear; he fell<br />
Incontinent, and dying, clench'd the dust.<br />
But tidings none the brazen-throated Mars<span class="lnm">635</span><br />
Tempestuous yet received, that his own son<br />
In bloody fight had fallen, for on the heights<br />
Olympian over-arch'd with clouds of gold<br />
He sat, where sat the other Powers divine,<br />
Prisoners together of the will of Jove.<span class="lnm">640</span><br />
Meantime, for slain Ascalaphus arose<br />
Conflict severe; Deiphobus his casque<br />
Resplendent seized, but swift as fiery Mars<br />
Assailing him, Meriones his arm<br />
Pierced with a spear, and from his idle hand<span class="lnm">645</span><br />
Fallen, the casque sonorous struck the ground.<br />
Again, as darts the vulture on his prey,<br />
<span class="pgnm">329</span><a name="page_329" id="page_329"></a>
Meriones assailing him, the lance<br />
Pluck'd from his arm, and to his band retired.<br />
Then, casting his fraternal arms around<span class="lnm">650</span><br />
Deiphobus, him young Polites led<br />
From the hoarse battle to his rapid steeds<br />
And his bright chariot in the distant rear,<br />
Which bore him back to Troy, languid and loud-<br />
Groaning, and bleeding from his recent wound.<span class="lnm">655</span><br />
Still raged the war, and infinite arose<br />
The clamor. Aphareus, Caletor's son,<br />
Turning to face &AElig;neas, in his throat<br />
Instant the hero's pointed lance received.<br />
With head reclined, and bearing to the ground<span class="lnm">660</span><br />
Buckler and helmet with him, in dark shades<br />
Of soul-divorcing death involved, he fell.<br />
Antilochus, observing Tho&ouml;n turn'd<br />
To flight, that moment pierced him; from his back<br />
He ripp'd the vein which through the trunk its course<span class="lnm">665</span><br />
Winds upward to the neck; that vein he ripp'd<br />
All forth; supine he fell, and with both hands<br />
Extended to his fellow-warriors, died.<br />
Forth sprang Antilochus to strip his arms,<br />
But watch'd, meantime, the Trojans, who in crowds<span class="lnm">670</span><br />
Encircling him, his splendid buckler broad<br />
Smote oft, but none with ruthless point prevail'd<br />
Even to inscribe the skin of Nestor's son,<br />
Whom Neptune, shaker of the shores, amid<br />
Innumerable darts kept still secure.<span class="lnm">675</span><br />
Yet never from his foes he shrank, but faced<br />
From side to side, nor idle slept his spear,<br />
But with rotation ceaseless turn'd and turn'd<br />
To every part, now levell'd at a foe<br />
Far-distant, at a foe, now, near at hand.<span class="lnm">680</span><br />
Nor he, thus occupied, unseen escaped<br />
By Asius' offspring Adamas, who close<br />
Advancing, struck the centre of his shield.<br />
But Neptune azure-hair'd so dear a life<br />
Denied to Adamas, and render'd vain<span class="lnm">685</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">330</span><a name="page_330" id="page_330"></a>
The weapon; part within his disk remain'd<br />
Like a seer'd stake, and part fell at his feet.<br />
Then Adamas, for his own life alarm'd,<br />
Retired, but as he went, Meriones<br />
Him reaching with his lance, the shame between<span class="lnm">690</span><br />
And navel pierced him, where the stroke of Mars<br />
Proves painful most to miserable man.<br />
There enter'd deep the weapon; down he fell,<br />
And in the dust lay panting as an ox<br />
Among the mountains pants by peasants held<span class="lnm">695</span><br />
In twisted bands, and dragg'd perforce along;<br />
So panted dying Adamas, but soon<br />
Ceased, for Meriones, approaching, pluck'd<br />
The weapon forth, and darkness veil'd his eyes.<br />
Helenus, with his heavy Thracian blade<span class="lnm">700</span><br />
Smiting the temples of Deipyrus,<br />
Dash'd off his helmet; from his brows remote<br />
It fell, and wandering roll'd, till at his feet<br />
Some warrior found it, and secured; meantime<br />
The sightless shades of death him wrapp'd around.<span class="lnm">705</span><br />
Grief at that spectacle the bosom fill'd<br />
Of valiant Menelaus; high he shook<br />
His radiant spear, and threatening him, advanced<br />
On royal Helenus, who ready stood<br />
With his bow bent. They met; impatient, one,<span class="lnm">710</span><br />
To give his pointed lance its rapid course,<br />
And one, to start his arrow from the nerve.<br />
The arrow of the son of Priam struck<br />
Atrides' hollow corselet, but the reed<br />
Glanced wide. As vetches or as swarthy beans<span class="lnm">715</span><br />
Leap from the van and fly athwart the floor,<br />
By sharp winds driven, and by the winnower's force,<br />
So from the corselet of the glorious Greek<br />
Wide-wandering flew the bitter shaft away.<br />
But Menelaus the left-hand transpierced<span class="lnm">720</span><br />
Of Helenus, and with the lance's point<br />
Fasten'd it to his bow; shunning a stroke<br />
More fatal, Helenus into his band<br />
<span class="pgnm">331</span><a name="page_331" id="page_331"></a>
Retired, his arm dependent at his side,<br />
And trailing, as he went, the ashen beam;<span class="lnm">725</span><br />
There, bold Agenor from his hand the lance<br />
Drew forth, then folded it with softest wool<br />
Around, sling-wool, and borrow'd from the sling<br />
Which his attendant into battle bore.<br />
Then sprang Pisander on the glorious Chief<span class="lnm">730</span><br />
The son of Atreus, but his evil fate<br />
Beckon'd him to his death in conflict fierce,<br />
Oh Menelaus, mighty Chief! with thee.<br />
And now they met, small interval between.<br />
Atrides hurl'd his weapon, and it err'd.<span class="lnm">735</span><br />
Pisander with his spear struck full the shield<br />
Of glorious Menelaus, but his force<br />
Resisted by the stubborn buckler broad<br />
Fail'd to transpierce it, and the weapon fell<br />
Snapp'd at the neck. Yet, when he struck, the heart<span class="lnm">740</span><br />
Rebounded of Pisander, full of hope.<br />
But Menelaus, drawing his bright blade,<br />
Sprang on him, while Pisander from behind<br />
His buckler drew a brazen battle-axe<br />
By its long haft of polish'd olive-wood,<span class="lnm">745</span><br />
And both Chiefs struck together. He the crest<br />
That crown'd the shaggy casque of Atreus' son<br />
Hew'd from its base, but Menelaus him<br />
In his swift onset smote full on the front<br />
Above his nose; sounded the shatter'd bone,<span class="lnm">750</span><br />
And his eyes both fell bloody at his feet.<br />
Convolved with pain he lay; then, on his breast<br />
Atrides setting fast his heel, tore off<br />
His armor, and exulting thus began.</p>
<p>  So shall ye leave at length the Grecian fleet,<span class="lnm">755</span><br />
Traitors, and never satisfied with war!<br />
Nor want ye other guilt, dogs and profane!<br />
But me have injured also, and defied<br />
The hot displeasure of high-thundering Jove<br />
The hospitable, who shall waste in time,<span class="lnm">760</span><br />
And level with the dust your lofty Troy.<br />
<span class="pgnm">332</span><a name="page_332" id="page_332"></a>
I wrong'd not you, yet bore ye far away<br />
My youthful bride who welcomed you, and stole<br />
My treasures also, and ye now are bent<br />
To burn Achaia's gallant fleet with fire<span class="lnm">765</span><br />
And slay her heroes; but your furious thirst<br />
Of battle shall hereafter meet a check.<br />
Oh, Father Jove! Thee wisest we account<br />
In heaven or earth, yet from thyself proceed<br />
All these calamities, who favor show'st<span class="lnm">770</span><br />
To this flagitious race the Trojans, strong<br />
In wickedness alone, and whose delight<br />
In war and bloodshed never can be cloy'd.<br />
All pleasures breed satiety, sweet sleep,<br />
Soft dalliance, music, and the graceful dance,<span class="lnm">775</span><br />
Though sought with keener appetite by most<br />
Than bloody war; but Troy still covets blood.</p>
<p>  So spake the royal Chief, and to his friends<br />
Pisander's gory spoils consigning, flew<br />
To mingle in the foremost fight again.<span class="lnm">780</span><br />
Him, next, Harpalion, offspring of the King<br />
Pyl&aelig;menes assail'd; to Troy he came<br />
Following his sire, but never thence return'd.<br />
He, from small distance, smote the central boss<br />
Of Menelaus' buckler with his lance,<span class="lnm">785</span><br />
But wanting power to pierce it, with an eye<br />
Of cautious circumspection, lest perchance<br />
Some spear should reach him, to his band retired.<br />
But him retiring with a brazen shaft<br />
Meriones pursued; swift flew the dart<span class="lnm">790</span><br />
To his right buttock, slipp'd beneath the bone,<br />
His bladder grazed, and started through before.<br />
There ended his retreat; sudden he sank<br />
And like a worm lay on the ground, his life<br />
Exhaling in his fellow-warrior's arms,<span class="lnm">795</span><br />
And with his sable blood soaking the plain.<br />
Around him flock'd his Paphlagonians bold,<br />
And in his chariot placed drove him to Troy,<br />
With whom his father went, mourning with tears<br />
<span class="pgnm">333</span><a name="page_333" id="page_333"></a>
A son, whose death he never saw avenged.<span class="lnm">800</span></p>
<p>  Him slain with indignation Paris view'd,<br />
For he, with numerous Paphlagonians more<br />
His guest had been; he, therefore, in the thirst<br />
Of vengeance, sent a brazen arrow forth.<br />
There was a certain Greek, Euchenor, son<span class="lnm">805</span><br />
Of Polyides the soothsayer, rich<br />
And brave in fight, and who in Corinth dwelt<br />
He, knowing well his fate, yet sail'd to Troy<br />
For Polyides oft, his reverend sire,<br />
Had prophecied that he should either die<span class="lnm">810</span><br />
By some dire malady at home, or, slain<br />
By Trojan hands, amid the fleet of Greece.<br />
He, therefore, shunning the reproach alike<br />
Of the Achaians, and that dire disease,<br />
Had join'd the Grecian host; him Paris pierced<span class="lnm">815</span><br />
The ear and jaw beneath; life at the stroke<br />
Left him, and darkness overspread his eyes.</p>
<p>  So raged the battle like devouring fire.<br />
But Hector dear to Jove not yet had learn'd,<br />
Nor aught surmised the havoc of his host<span class="lnm">820</span><br />
Made on the left, where victory crown'd well-nigh<br />
The Grecians animated to the fight<br />
By Neptune seconding himself their arms.<br />
He, where he first had started through the gate<br />
After dispersion of the shielded Greeks<span class="lnm">825</span><br />
Compact, still persevered. The galleys there<br />
Of Ajax and Protesila&uuml;s stood<br />
Updrawn above the hoary Deep; the wall<br />
Was there of humblest structure, and the steeds<br />
And warriors there conflicted furious most.<span class="lnm">830</span><br />
The Epeans there and I&auml;onians<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_13-12">[12]</a> robed-<br />
Prolix, the Phthians,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_13-13">[13]</a> Locrians, and the bold<br />
<span class="pgnm">334</span><a name="page_334" id="page_334"></a>
B&oelig;tians check'd the terrible assault<br />
Of Hector, noble Chief, ardent as flame,<br />
Yet not repulsed him. Chosen Athenians form'd<span class="lnm">835</span><br />
The van, by Peteos' son, Menestheus, led,<br />
Whose high command undaunted Bias shared,<br />
Phidas and Stichius. The Epean host<br />
Under Amphion, Dracius, Meges, fought.<br />
Podarces brave in arms the Phthians ruled,<span class="lnm">840</span><br />
And Medon (Medon was by spurious birth<br />
Brother of Ajax O&iuml;liades,<br />
And for his uncle's death, whom he had slain,<br />
The brother of O&iuml;leus' wife, abode<br />
In Phylace; but from Iphiclus sprang<span class="lnm">845</span><br />
Podarces;) these, all station'd in the front<br />
Of Phthias' hardy sons, together strove<br />
With the B&oelig;otians for the fleet's defence.<br />
Ajax the swift swerved never from the side<br />
Of Ajax son of Telamon a step,<span class="lnm">850</span><br />
But as in some deep fallow two black steers<br />
Labor combined, dragging the ponderous plow,<br />
The briny sweat around their rooted horns<br />
Oozes profuse; they, parted as they toil<br />
Along the furrow, by the yoke alone,<span class="lnm">855</span><br />
Cleave to its bottom sheer the stubborn glebe,<br />
So, side by side, they, persevering fought.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_13-14">[14]</a><br />
The son of Telamon a people led<br />
Numerous and bold, who, when his bulky limbs<br />
Fail'd overlabor'd, eased him of his shield.<span class="lnm">860</span><br />
Not so attended by his Locrians fought<br />
O&iuml;leus' valiant son; pitch'd battle them<br />
Suited not, unprovided with bright casques<br />
Of hairy crest, with ashen spears, and shields<br />
Of ample orb; for, trusting in the bow<span class="lnm">865</span><br />
And twisted sling alone, they came to Troy,<br />
<span class="pgnm">335</span><a name="page_335" id="page_335"></a>
And broke with shafts and volley'd stones the ranks.<br />
Thus occupying, clad in burnish'd arms,<br />
The van, these two with Hector and his host<br />
Conflicted, while the Locrians from behind<span class="lnm">870</span><br />
Vex'd them with shafts, secure; nor could the men<br />
Of Ilium stand, by such a shower confused.<br />
Then, driven with dreadful havoc thence, the foe<br />
To wind-swept Ilium had again retired.<br />
Had not Polydamas, at Hector's side<span class="lnm">875</span><br />
Standing, the dauntless hero thus address'd.</p>
<p>  Hector! Thou ne'er canst listen to advice;<br />
But think'st thou, that if heaven in feats of arms<br />
Give thee pre-eminence, thou must excel<br />
Therefore in council also all mankind?<span class="lnm">880</span><br />
No. All-sufficiency is not for thee.<br />
To one, superior force in arms is given,<br />
Skill to another in the graceful dance,<br />
Sweet song and powers of music to a third,<br />
And to a fourth loud-thundering Jove imparts<span class="lnm">885</span><br />
Wisdom, which profits many, and which saves<br />
Whole cities oft, though reverenced but by few.<br />
Yet hear; I speak as wisest seems to me.<br />
War, like a fiery circle, all around<br />
Environs thee; the Trojans, since they pass'd<span class="lnm">890</span><br />
The bulwark, either hold themselves aloof,<br />
Or, wide-dispersed among the galleys, cope<br />
With numbers far superior to their own.<br />
Retiring, therefore, summon all our Chiefs<br />
To consultation on the sum of all,<span class="lnm">895</span><br />
Whether (should heaven so prosper us) to rush<br />
Impetuous on the gallant barks of Greece,<br />
Or to retreat secure; for much I dread<br />
Lest the Achaians punctually refund<br />
All yesterday's arrear, since yonder Chief<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_13-15">[15]</a><span class="lnm">900</span><br />
Insatiable with battle still abides<br />
Within the fleet, nor longer, as I judge,<br />
Will rest a mere spectator of the field.</p>
<p>  So spake Polydamas, whose safe advice<br />
<span class="pgnm">336</span><a name="page_336" id="page_336"></a>
Pleased Hector; from his chariot down he leap'd<span class="lnm">905</span><br />
All arm'd, and in wing'd accents thus replied.</p>
<p>  Polydamas! here gather all the Chiefs;<br />
I haste into the fight, and my commands<br />
Once issued there, incontinent return.</p>
<p>  He ended, and conspicuous as the height<span class="lnm">910</span><br />
Of some snow-crested mountain, shouting ranged<br />
The Trojans and confederates of Troy.<br />
They swift around Polydamas, brave son<br />
Of Panthus, at the voice of Hector, ran.<br />
Himself with hasty strides the front, meantime,<span class="lnm">915</span><br />
Of battle roam'd, seeking from rank to rank<br />
Asius Hyrtacides, with Asius' son<br />
Adamas, and Deiphobus, and the might<br />
Of Helenus, his royal brother bold.<br />
Them neither altogether free from hurt<span class="lnm">920</span><br />
He found, nor living all. Beneath the sterns<br />
Of the Achaian ships some slaughter'd lay<br />
By Grecian hands; some stricken by the spear<br />
Within the rampart sat, some by the sword.<br />
But leftward of the woful field he found,<span class="lnm">925</span><br />
Ere long, bright Helen's paramour his band<br />
Exhorting to the fight. Hector approach'd,<br />
And him, in fierce displeasure, thus bespake.</p>
<p>  Curst Paris, specious, fraudulent and lewd!<br />
Where is Deiphobus, and where the might<span class="lnm">930</span><br />
Of royal Helenus? Where Adamas<br />
Offspring of Asius, and where Asius, son<br />
Of Hyrtacus, and where Othryoneus?<br />
Now lofty Ilium from her topmost height<br />
Falls headlong, now is thy own ruin sure!<span class="lnm">935</span></p>
<p>  To whom the godlike Paris thus replied.<br />
Since Hector! thou art pleased with no just cause<br />
To censure me, I may decline, perchance,<br />
Much more the battle on some future day,<br />
For I profess some courage, even I.<span class="lnm">940</span><br />
Witness our constant conflict with the Greeks<br />
Here, on this spot, since first led on by thee<br />
<span class="pgnm">337</span><a name="page_337" id="page_337"></a>
The host of Troy waged battle at the ships.<br />
But those our friends of whom thou hast inquired<br />
Are slain, Deiphobus alone except<span class="lnm">945</span><br />
And royal Helenus, who in the hand<br />
Bear each a wound inflicted by the spear,<br />
And have retired; but Jove their life preserved.<br />
Come now&mdash;conduct us whither most thine heart<br />
Prompts thee, and thou shalt find us ardent all<span class="lnm">950</span><br />
To face like danger; what we can, we will,<br />
The best and most determined can no more.</p>
<p>  So saying, the hero soothed his brother's mind.<br />
Then moved they both toward the hottest war<br />
Together, where Polydamas the brave,<span class="lnm">955</span><br />
Phalces, Cebriones, Orth&aelig;us fought,<br />
Palmys and Polyph&oelig;tes, godlike Chief,<br />
And Morys and Ascanius, gallant sons<br />
Both of Hippotion. They at Troy arrived<br />
From fair Ascania the preceding morn,<span class="lnm">960</span><br />
In recompense for aid<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_13-16">[16]</a> by Priam lent<br />
Erewhile to Phrygia, and, by Jove impell'd,<br />
Now waged the furious battle side by side.<br />
The march of these at once, was as the sound<br />
Of mighty winds from deep-hung thunder-clouds<span class="lnm">965</span><br />
Descending; clamorous the blast and wild<br />
With ocean mingles; many a billow, then,<br />
Upridged rides turbulent the sounding flood,<br />
Foam-crested billow after billow driven,<br />
So moved the host of Troy, rank after rank<span class="lnm">970</span><br />
Behind their Chiefs, all dazzling bright in arms.<br />
Before them Priameian Hector strode<br />
Fierce as gore-tainted Mars, and his broad shield<br />
Advancing came, heavy with hides, and thick-<br />
Plated with brass; his helmet on his brows<span class="lnm">975</span><br />
Refulgent shook, and in its turn he tried<br />
The force of every phalanx, if perchance<br />
Behind his broad shield pacing he might shake<br />
Their steadfast order; but he bore not down<br />
<span class="pgnm">338</span><a name="page_338" id="page_338"></a>
The spirit of the firm Achaian host.<span class="lnm">980</span><br />
Then Ajax striding forth, him, first, defied.</p>
<p>  Approach. Why temptest thou the Greeks to fear?<br />
No babes are we in aught that appertains<br />
To arms, though humbled by the scourge of Jove.<br />
Thou cherishest the foolish hope to burn<span class="lnm">985</span><br />
Our fleet with fire; but even we have hearts<br />
Prepared to guard it, and your populous Troy,<br />
By us dismantled and to pillage given,<br />
Shall perish sooner far. Know this thyself<br />
Also; the hour is nigh when thou shalt ask<span class="lnm">990</span><br />
In prayer to Jove and all the Gods of heaven,<br />
That speed more rapid than the falcon's flight<br />
May wing thy coursers, while, exciting dense<br />
The dusty plain, they whirl thee back to Troy.</p>
<p>  While thus he spake, sublime on the right-hand<span class="lnm">995</span><br />
An eagle soar'd; confident in the sign<br />
The whole Achaian host with loud acclaim<br />
Hail'd it. Then glorious Hector thus replied.</p>
<p>  Brainless and big, what means this boast of thine,<br />
Earth-cumberer Ajax? Would I were the son<span class="lnm">1000</span><br />
As sure, for ever, of almighty Jove<br />
And Juno, and such honor might receive<br />
Henceforth as Pallas and Apollo share,<br />
As comes this day with universal wo<br />
Fraught for the Grecians, among whom thyself<span class="lnm">1005</span><br />
Shalt also perish if thou dare abide<br />
My massy spear, which shall thy pamper'd flesh<br />
Disfigure, and amid the barks of Greece<br />
Falling, thou shalt the vultures with thy bulk<br />
Enormous satiate, and the dogs of Troy.<span class="lnm">1010</span></p>
<p>  He spake, and led his host; with clamor loud<br />
They follow'd him, and all the distant rear<br />
Came shouting on. On the other side the Greeks<br />
Re-echoed shout for shout, all undismay'd,<br />
And waiting firm the bravest of their foes.<span class="lnm">1015</span><br />
Upwent the double roar into the heights<br />
Ethereal, and among the beams of Jove.</p>

<p class="outd">Agamemnon and the other wounded Chiefs taking Nestor with them, visit
the battle. Juno having borrowed the Cestus of Venus, first engages the
assistance of Sleep, then hastens to Ida to inveigle Jove. She prevails.
Jove sleeps; and Neptune takes that opportunity to succor the Grecians.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="noind">Nor was that cry by Nestor unperceived<br />
Though drinking, who in words wing'd with surprise<br />
The son of &AElig;sculapius thus address'd.</p>
<p>  Divine Machaon! think what this may bode.<br />
The cry of our young warriors at the ships<span class="lnm">5</span><br />
Grows louder; sitting here, the sable wine<br />
Quaff thou, while bright-hair'd Hecamede warms<br />
A bath, to cleanse thy crimson stains away.<br />
I from yon eminence will learn the cause.</p>
<p>  So saying, he took a shield radiant with brass<span class="lnm">10</span><br />
There lying in the tent, the shield well-forged<br />
Of valiant Thrasymedes, his own son<br />
(For he had borne to fight his father's shield)<br />
And arming next his hand with a keen lance<br />
Stood forth before the tent. Thence soon he saw<span class="lnm">15</span><br />
Foul deeds and strange, the Grecian host confused,<br />
Their broken ranks flying before the host<br />
Of Ilium, and the rampart overthrown.<br />
As when the wide sea, darken'd over all<br />
Its silent flood, forebodes shrill winds to blow,<span class="lnm">20</span><br />
The doubtful waves roll yet to neither side,<br />
Till swept at length by a decisive gale;<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_14-1">[1]</a><br />
<span class="pgnm">342</span><a name="page_342" id="page_342"></a>
So stood the senior, with distressful doubts<br />
Conflicting anxious, whether first to seek<br />
The Grecian host, or Agamemnon's self<span class="lnm">25</span><br />
The sovereign, and at length that course preferr'd.<br />
Meantime with mutual carnage they the field<br />
Spread far and wide, and by spears double-edged<br />
Smitten, and by the sword their corselets rang.</p>
<p>  The royal Chiefs ascending from the fleet,<span class="lnm">30</span><br />
Ulysses, Diomede, and Atreus' son<br />
Imperial Agamemnon, who had each<br />
Bled in the battle, met him on his way.<br />
For from the war remote they had updrawn<br />
Their galleys on the shore of the gray Deep,<span class="lnm">35</span><br />
The foremost to the plain, and at the sterns<br />
Of that exterior line had built the wall.<br />
For, spacious though it were, the shore alone<br />
That fleet sufficed not, incommoding much<br />
The people; wherefore they had ranged the ships<span class="lnm">40</span><br />
Line above line gradual, and the bay<br />
Between both promontories, all was fill'd.<br />
They, therefore, curious to survey the fight,<br />
Came forth together, leaning on the spear,<br />
When Nestor met them; heavy were their hearts,<span class="lnm">45</span><br />
And at the sight of him still more alarm'd,<br />
Whom royal Agamemnon thus bespake.</p>
<p>  Neleian Nestor, glory of the Greeks!<br />
What moved thee to forsake yon bloody field,<br />
And urged thee hither? Cause I see of fear,<span class="lnm">50</span><br />
Lest furious Hector even now his threat<br />
Among the Trojans publish'd, verify,<br />
That he would never enter Ilium more<br />
Till he had burn'd our fleet, and slain ourselves.<br />
So threaten'd Hector, and shall now perform.<span class="lnm">55</span><br />
Alas! alas! the Achaians brazen-greaved<br />
All, like Achilles, have deserted me<br />
Resentful, and decline their fleet's defence.</p>
<p>  To whom Gerenian Nestor thus replied.<br />
Those threats are verified; nor Jove himself<span class="lnm">60</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">343</span><a name="page_343" id="page_343"></a>
The Thunderer can disappoint them now;<br />
For our chief strength in which we trusted most<br />
That it should guard impregnably secure<br />
Our navy and ourselves, the wall hath fallen.<br />
Hence all this conflict by our host sustain'd<span class="lnm">65</span><br />
Among the ships; nor could thy keenest sight<br />
Inform thee where in the Achaian camp<br />
Confusion most prevails, such deaths are dealt<br />
Promiscuous, and the cry ascends to heaven.<br />
But come&mdash;consult we on the sum of all,<span class="lnm">70</span><br />
If counsel yet may profit. As for you,<br />
Ye shall have exhortation none from me<br />
To seek the fight; the wounded have excuse.</p>
<p>  Whom Agamemnon answer'd, King of men.<br />
Ah Nestor! if beneath our very sterns<span class="lnm">75</span><br />
The battle rage, if neither trench nor wall<br />
Constructed with such labor, and supposed<br />
Of strength to guard impregnably secure<br />
Our navy and ourselves, avail us aught,<br />
It is because almighty Jove hath will'd<span class="lnm">80</span><br />
That the Achaian host should perish here<br />
Inglorious, from their country far remote.<br />
When he vouchsafed assistance to the Greeks,<br />
I knew it well; and now, not less I know<br />
That high as the immortal Gods he lifts<span class="lnm">85</span><br />
Our foes to glory, and depresses us.<br />
Haste therefore all, and act as I advise.<br />
Our ships&mdash;all those that nearest skirt the Deep,<br />
Launch we into the sacred flood, and moor<br />
With anchors safely, till o'ershadowing night<span class="lnm">90</span><br />
(If night itself may save us) shall arrive.<br />
Then may we launch the rest; for I no shame<br />
Account it, even by 'vantage of the night<br />
To fly destruction. Wiser him I deem<br />
Who 'scapes his foe, than whom his foe enthralls.<span class="lnm">95</span></p>
<p>  But him Ulysses, frowning stern, reproved.<br />
What word, Atrides, now hath pass'd thy lips?<br />
Counsellor of despair! thou should'st command<br />
<span class="pgnm">344</span><a name="page_344" id="page_344"></a>
(And would to heaven thou didst) a different host,<br />
Some dastard race, not ours; whom Jove ordains<span class="lnm">100</span><br />
From youth to hoary age to weave the web<br />
Of toilsome warfare, till we perish all.<br />
Wilt thou the spacious city thus renounce<br />
For which such numerous woes we have endured?<br />
Hush! lest some other hear; it is a word<span class="lnm">105</span><br />
Which no man qualified by years mature<br />
To speak discreetly, no man bearing rule<br />
O'er such a people as confess thy sway,<br />
Should suffer to contaminate his lips.<br />
I from my soul condemn thee, and condemn<span class="lnm">110</span><br />
Thy counsel, who persuad'st us in the heat<br />
Of battle terrible as this, to launch<br />
Our fleet into the waves, that we may give<br />
Our too successful foes their full desire,<br />
And that our own prepondering scale<span class="lnm">115</span><br />
May plunge us past all hope; for while they draw<br />
Their galleys down, the Grecians shall but ill<br />
Sustain the fight, seaward will cast their eyes<br />
And shun the battle, bent on flight alone.<br />
Then, shall they rue thy counsel, King of men!<span class="lnm">120</span></p>
<p>  To whom the imperial leader of the Greeks.<br />
Thy sharp reproof, Ulysses, hath my soul<br />
Pierced deeply. Yet I gave no such command<br />
That the Achaians should their galleys launch,<br />
Would they, or would they not. No. I desire<span class="lnm">125</span><br />
That young or old, some other may advice<br />
More prudent give, and he shall please me well.</p>
<p>  Then thus the gallant Diomede replied.<br />
That man is near, and may ye but be found<br />
Tractable, our inquiry shall be short.<span class="lnm">130</span><br />
Be patient each, nor chide me nor reproach<br />
Because I am of greener years than ye,<br />
For I am sprung from an illustrious Sire,<br />
From Tydeus, who beneath his hill of earth<br />
Lies now entomb'd at Thebes. Three noble sons<span class="lnm">135</span><br />
Were born to Portheus, who in Pleuro dwelt,<br />
<span class="pgnm">345</span><a name="page_345" id="page_345"></a>
And on the heights of Calydon; the first<br />
Agrius; the second Melas; and the third<br />
Brave Oeneus, father of my father, famed<br />
For virtuous qualities above the rest.<span class="lnm">140</span><br />
Oeneus still dwelt at home; but wandering thence<br />
My father dwelt in Argos; so the will<br />
Of Jove appointed, and of all the Gods.<br />
There he espoused the daughter of the King<br />
Adrastus, occupied a mansion rich<span class="lnm">145</span><br />
In all abundance; many a field possess'd<br />
Of wheat, well-planted gardens, numerous flocks,<br />
And was expert in spearmanship esteem'd<br />
Past all the Grecians. I esteem'd it right<br />
That ye should hear these things, for they are true.<span class="lnm">150</span><br />
Ye will not, therefore, as I were obscure<br />
And of ignoble origin, reject<br />
What I shall well advise. Expedience bids<br />
That, wounded as we are, we join the host.<br />
We will preserve due distance from the range<span class="lnm">155</span><br />
Of spears and arrows, lest already gall'd,<br />
We suffer worse; but we will others urge<br />
To combat, who have stood too long aloof,<br />
Attentive only to their own repose.</p>
<p>  He spake, whom all approved, and forth they went,<span class="lnm">160</span><br />
Imperial Agamemnon at their head.</p>
<p>  Nor watch'd the glorious Shaker of the shores<br />
In vain, but like a man time-worn approach'd,<br />
And, seizing Agamemnon's better hand,<br />
In accents wing'd the monarch thus address'd.<span class="lnm">165</span></p>
<p>  Atrides! now exults the vengeful heart<br />
Of fierce Achilles, viewing at his ease<br />
The flight and slaughter of Achaia's host;<br />
For he is mad, and let him perish such,<br />
And may his portion from the Gods be shame!<span class="lnm">170</span><br />
But as for thee, not yet the powers of heaven<br />
Thee hate implacable; the Chiefs of Troy<br />
Shall cover yet with cloudy dust the breadth<br />
Of all the plain, and backward from the camp<br />
<span class="pgnm">346</span><a name="page_346" id="page_346"></a>
To Ilium's gates thyself shalt see them driven.<span class="lnm">175</span></p>
<p>  He ceased, and shouting traversed swift the field.<br />
Loud as nine thousand or ten thousand shout<br />
In furious battle mingled, Neptune sent<br />
His voice abroad, force irresistible<br />
Infusing into every Grecian heart,<span class="lnm">180</span><br />
And thirst of battle not to be assuaged.</p>
<p>  But Juno of the golden throne stood forth<br />
On the Olympian summit, viewing thence<br />
The field, where clear distinguishing the God<br />
Of ocean, her own brother, sole engaged<span class="lnm">185</span><br />
Amid the glorious battle, glad was she.<br />
Seeing Jove also on the topmost point<br />
Of spring-fed Ida seated, she conceived<br />
Hatred against him, and thenceforth began<br />
Deliberate how best she might deceive<span class="lnm">190</span><br />
The Thunderer, and thus at last resolved;<br />
Attired with skill celestial to descend<br />
On Ida, with a hope to allure him first<br />
Won by her beauty to a fond embrace,<br />
Then closing fast in balmy sleep profound<span class="lnm">195</span><br />
His eyes, to elude his vigilance, secure.<br />
She sought her chamber; Vulcan her own son<br />
That chamber built. He framed the solid doors,<br />
And to the posts fast closed them with a key<br />
Mysterious, which, herself except, in heaven<span class="lnm">200</span><br />
None understood. Entering she secured<br />
The splendid portal. First, she laved all o'er<br />
Her beauteous body with ambrosial lymph,<br />
Then polish'd it with richest oil divine<br />
Of boundless fragrance;<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_14-2">[2]</a> oil that in the courts<span class="lnm">205</span><br />
Eternal only shaken, through the skies<br />
Breathed odors, and through all the distant earth.<br />
Her whole fair body with those sweets bedew'd,<br />
She passed the comb through her ambrosial hair,<br />
<span class="pgnm">347</span><a name="page_347" id="page_347"></a>
And braided her bright locks streaming profuse<span class="lnm">210</span><br />
From her immortal brows; with golden studs<br />
She made her gorgeous mantle fast before,<br />
Ethereal texture, labor of the hands<br />
Of Pallas beautified with various art,<br />
And braced it with a zone fringed all around<span class="lnm">215</span><br />
A hundred fold; her pendants triple-gemm'd<br />
Luminous, graceful, in her ears she hung,<br />
And covering all her glories with a veil<br />
Sun-bright, new-woven, bound to her fair feet<br />
Her sandals elegant. Thus full attired,<span class="lnm">220</span><br />
In all her ornaments, she issued forth,<br />
And beckoning Venus from the other powers<br />
Of heaven apart, the Goddess thus bespake.</p>
<p>  Daughter beloved! shall I obtain my suit,<br />
Or wilt thou thwart me, angry that I aid<span class="lnm">225</span><br />
The Grecians, while thine aid is given to Troy?</p>
<p>  To whom Jove's daughter Venus thus replied.<br />
What would majestic Juno, daughter dread<br />
Of Saturn, sire of Jove? I feel a mind<br />
Disposed to gratify thee, if thou ask<span class="lnm">230</span><br />
Things possible, and possible to me.</p>
<p>  Then thus with wiles veiling her deep design<br />
Imperial Juno. Give me those desires,<br />
That love-enkindling power by which thou sway'st<br />
Immortal hearts and mortal, all alike;<span class="lnm">235</span><br />
For to the green earth's utmost bounds I go,<br />
To visit there the parent of the Gods,<br />
Oceanus, and Tethys his espoused,<br />
Mother of all. They kindly from the hands<br />
Of Rhea took, and with parental care<span class="lnm">240</span><br />
Sustain'd and cherish'd me, what time from heaven<br />
The Thunderer hurled down Saturn, and beneath<br />
The earth fast bound him and the barren Deep.<br />
Them go I now to visit, and their feuds<br />
Innumerable to compose; for long<span class="lnm">245</span><br />
They have from conjugal embrace abstain'd<br />
Through mutual wrath, whom by persuasive speech<br />
<span class="pgnm">348</span><a name="page_348" id="page_348"></a>
Might I restore into each other's arms,<br />
They would for ever love me and revere.</p>
<p>  Her, foam-born Venus then, Goddess of smiles,<span class="lnm">250</span><br />
Thus answer'd. Thy request, who in the arms<br />
Of Jove reposest the omnipotent,<br />
Nor just it were nor seemly to refuse.</p>
<p>  So saying, the cincture from her breast she loosed<br />
Embroider'd, various, her all-charming zone.<span class="lnm">255</span><br />
It was an ambush of sweet snares, replete<br />
With love, desire, soft intercourse of hearts,<br />
And music of resistless whisper'd sounds<br />
That from the wisest steal their best resolves;<br />
She placed it in her hands and thus she said.<span class="lnm">260</span></p>
<p>  Take this&mdash;this girdle fraught with every charm.<br />
Hide this within thy bosom, and return,<br />
Whate'er thy purpose, mistress of it all.</p>
<p>  She spake; imperial Juno smiled, and still<br />
Smiling complacent, bosom'd safe the zone.<span class="lnm">265</span><br />
Then Venus to her father's court return'd,<br />
And Juno, starting from the Olympian height,<br />
O'erflew Pieria and the lovely plains<br />
Of broad Emathia; soaring thence she swept<br />
The snow-clad summits of the Thracian hills<span class="lnm">270</span><br />
Steed-famed, nor printed, as she passed, the soil.<br />
From Athos o'er the foaming billows borne<br />
She came to Lemnos, city and abode<br />
Of noble Thoas, and there meeting Sleep,<br />
Brother of Death, she press'd his hand, and said,<span class="lnm">275</span></p>
<p>  Sleep, over all, both Gods and men, supreme!<br />
If ever thou hast heard, hear also now<br />
My suit; I will be grateful evermore.<br />
Seal for me fast the radiant eyes of Jove<br />
In the instant of his gratified desire.<span class="lnm">280</span><br />
Thy recompense shall be a throne of gold,<br />
Bright, incorruptible; my limping son,<br />
Vulcan, shall fashion it himself with art<br />
Laborious, and, beneath, shall place a stool<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_14-3">[3]</a><br />
<span class="pgnm">349</span><a name="page_349" id="page_349"></a>
For thy fair feet, at the convivial board.<span class="lnm">285</span></p>
<p>  Then answer thus the tranquil Sleep returned<br />
Great Saturn's daughter, awe-inspiring Queen!<br />
All other of the everlasting Gods<br />
I could with ease make slumber, even the streams<br />
Of Ocean, Sire of all.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_14-4">[4]</a> Not so the King<span class="lnm">290</span><br />
The son of Saturn: him, unless himself<br />
Give me command, I dare not lull to rest,<br />
Or even approach him, taught as I have been<br />
Already in the school of thy commands<br />
That wisdom. I forget not yet the day<span class="lnm">295</span><br />
When, Troy laid waste, that valiant son<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_14-5">[5]</a> of his<br />
Sail'd homeward: then my influence I diffused<br />
Soft o'er the sovereign intellect of Jove;<br />
While thou, against the Hero plotting harm,<br />
Didst rouse the billows with tempestuous blasts,<span class="lnm">300</span><br />
And separating him from all his friend,<br />
Brought'st him to populous Cos. Then Jove awoke,<br />
And, hurling in his wrath the Gods about,<br />
Sought chiefly me, whom far below all ken<br />
He had from heaven cast down into the Deep,<span class="lnm">305</span><br />
But Night, resistless vanquisher of all,<br />
Both Gods and men, preserved me; for to her<br />
I fled for refuge. So the Thunderer cool'd,<br />
Though sore displeased, and spared me through a fear<br />
To violate the peaceful sway of Night.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_14-6">[6]</a><span class="lnm">310</span><br />
And thou wouldst now embroil me yet again!</p>
<p>  To whom majestic Juno thus replied.<br />
Ah, wherefore, Sleep! shouldst thou indulge a fear<br />
So groundless?  Chase it from thy mind afar.<br />
Think'st thou the Thunderer as intent to serve<span class="lnm">315</span><br />
The Trojans, and as jealous in their cause<br />
As erst for Hercules, his genuine son?<br />
Come then, and I will bless thee with a bride;<br />
<span class="pgnm">350</span><a name="page_350" id="page_350"></a>
One of the younger Graces shall be thine,<br />
Pasithea, day by day still thy desire.<span class="lnm">320</span></p>
<p>  She spake; Sleep heard delighted, and replied.<br />
By the inviolable Stygian flood<br />
Swear to me; lay thy right hand on the glebe<br />
All-teeming, lay thy other on the face<br />
Of the flat sea, that all the Immortal Powers<span class="lnm">325</span><br />
Who compass Saturn in the nether realms<br />
May witness, that thou givest me for a bride<br />
The younger Grace whom thou hast named, divine<br />
Pasithea, day by day still my desire.</p>
<p>  He said, nor beauteous Juno not complied,<span class="lnm">330</span><br />
But sware, by name invoking all the powers<br />
Titanian call'd who in the lowest gulf<br />
Dwell under Tartarus, omitting none.<br />
Her oath with solemn ceremonial sworn,<br />
Together forth they went; Lemnos they left<span class="lnm">335</span><br />
And Imbrus, city of Thrace, and in dark clouds<br />
Mantled, with gliding ease swam through the air<br />
To Ida's mount with rilling waters vein'd,<br />
Parent of savage beasts; at Lectos<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_14-7">[7]</a> first<br />
They quitted Ocean, overpassing high<span class="lnm">340</span><br />
The dry land, while beneath their feet the woods<br />
Their spiry summits waved. There, unperceived<br />
By Jove, Sleep mounted Ida's loftiest pine<br />
Of growth that pierced the sky, and hidden sat<br />
Secure by its expanded boughs, the bird<span class="lnm">345</span><br />
Shrill-voiced resembling in the mountains seen,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_14-8">[8]</a><br />
Chalcis in heaven, on earth Cymindis named.</p>
<p>  But Juno swift to Gargarus the top<br />
Of Ida, soar'd, and there Jove saw his spouse.<br />
&mdash;Saw her&mdash;and in his breast the same love felt<span class="lnm">350</span><br />
Rekindled vehement, which had of old<br />
Join'd them, when, by their parents unperceived,<br />
They stole aside, and snatch'd their first embrace.<br />
Soon he accosted her, and thus inquired.</p>
<p><span class="pgnm">351</span><a name="page_351" id="page_351"></a>
  Juno! what region seeking hast thou left<span class="lnm">355</span><br />
The Olympian summit, and hast here arrived<br />
With neither steed nor chariot in thy train?</p>
<p>  To whom majestic Juno thus replied<br />
Dissembling. To the green earth's end I go,<br />
To visit there the parent of the Gods<span class="lnm">360</span><br />
Oceanus, and Tethys his espoused,<br />
Mother of all. They kindly from the hands<br />
Of Rhea took, and with parental care<br />
Sustain'd and cherish'd me;<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_14-9">[9]</a> to them I haste<br />
Their feuds innumerable to compose,<span class="lnm">365</span><br />
Who disunited by intestine strife<br />
Long time, from conjugal embrace abstain.<br />
My steeds, that lightly over dank and dry<br />
Shall bear me, at the rooted base I left<br />
Of Ida river-vein'd. But for thy sake<span class="lnm">370</span><br />
From the Olympian summit I arrive,<br />
Lest journeying remote to the abode<br />
Of Ocean, and with no consent of thine<br />
Entreated first, I should, perchance, offend.</p>
<p>  To whom the cloud-assembler God replied.<span class="lnm">375</span><br />
Juno! thy journey thither may be made<br />
Hereafter. Let us turn to dalliance now.<br />
For never Goddess pour'd, nor woman yet<br />
So full a tide of love into my breast;<br />
I never loved Ixion's consort thus<span class="lnm">380</span><br />
Who bore Piritho&uuml;s, wise as we in heaven;<br />
Nor sweet Acrisian Dan&auml;e, from whom<br />
Sprang Perseus, noblest of the race of man;<br />
Nor Ph&oelig;nix' daughter fair,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_14-10">[10]</a> of whom were born<br />
Minos unmatch'd but by the powers above,<span class="lnm">385</span><br />
And Rhadamanthus; nor yet Semele,<br />
Nor yet Alcmena, who in Thebes produced<br />
The valiant Hercules; and though my son<br />
By Semele were Bacchus, joy of man;<br />
<span class="pgnm">352</span><a name="page_352" id="page_352"></a>
Nor Ceres golden-hair'd, nor high-enthroned<span class="lnm">390</span><br />
Latona in the skies, no&mdash;nor thyself<br />
As now I love thee, and my soul perceive<br />
O'erwhelm'd with sweetness of intense desire.</p>
<p>  Then thus majestic Juno her reply<br />
Framed artful. Oh unreasonable haste!<span class="lnm">395</span><br />
What speaks the Thunderer? If on Ida's heights.<br />
Where all is open and to view exposed<br />
Thou wilt that we embrace, what must betide,<br />
Should any of the everlasting Gods<br />
Observe us, and declare it to the rest?<span class="lnm">400</span><br />
Never could I, arising, seek again,<br />
Thy mansion, so unseemly were the deed.<br />
But if thy inclinations that way tend,<br />
Thou hast a chamber; it is Vulcan's work,<br />
Our son's; he framed and fitted to its posts<span class="lnm">405</span><br />
The solid portal; thither let us his,<br />
And there repose, since such thy pleasure seems.</p>
<p>  To whom the cloud-assembler Deity.<br />
Fear thou not, Juno, lest the eye of man<br />
Or of a God discern us; at my word<span class="lnm">410</span><br />
A golden cloud shall fold us so around,<br />
That not the Sun himself shall through that veil<br />
Discover aught, though keenest-eyed of all.</p>
<p>  So spake the son of Saturn, and his spouse<br />
Fast lock'd within his arms. Beneath them earth<span class="lnm">415</span><br />
With sudden herbage teem'd; at once upsprang<br />
The crocus soft, the lotus bathed in dew,<br />
And the crisp hyacinth with clustering bells;<br />
Thick was their growth, and high above the ground<br />
Upbore them. On that flowery couch they lay,<span class="lnm">420</span><br />
Invested with a golden cloud that shed<br />
Bright dew-drops all around.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_14-11">[11]</a> His heart at ease,<br />
There lay the Sire of all, by Sleep and Love<br />
Vanquish'd on lofty Gargarus, his spouse<br />
Constraining still with amorous embrace.<span class="lnm">425</span><br />
Then, gentle Sleep to the Achaian camp<br />
<span class="pgnm">353</span><a name="page_353" id="page_353"></a>
Sped swift away, with tidings for the ear<br />
Of earth-encircler Neptune charged; him soon<br />
He found, and in wing'd accents thus began.</p>
<p>  Now Neptune, yield the Greeks effectual aid,<span class="lnm">430</span><br />
And, while the moment lasts of Jove's repose,<br />
Make victory theirs; for him in slumbers soft<br />
I have involved, while Juno by deceit<br />
Prevailing, lured him with the bait of love.</p>
<p>  He said, and swift departed to his task<span class="lnm">435</span><br />
Among the nations; but his tidings urged<br />
Neptune with still more ardor to assist<br />
The Dana&iuml;; he leap'd into the van<br />
Afar, and thus exhorted them aloud.</p>
<p>  Oh Argives! yield we yet again the day<span class="lnm">440</span><br />
To Priameian Hector? Shall he seize<br />
Our ships, and make the glory all his own?<br />
Such is his expectation, so he vaunts,<br />
For that Achilles leaves not yet his camp,<br />
Resentful; but of him small need, I judge,<span class="lnm">445</span><br />
Should here be felt, could once the rest be roused<br />
To mutual aid. Act, then, as I advise.<br />
The best and broadest bucklers of the host,<br />
And brightest helmets put we on, and arm'd<br />
With longest spears, advance; myself will lead;<span class="lnm">450</span><br />
And trust me, furious though he be, the son<br />
Of Priam flies. Ye then who feel your hearts<br />
Undaunted, but are arm'd with smaller shields,<br />
Them give to those who fear, and in exchange<br />
Their stronger shields and broader take yourselves.<span class="lnm">455</span></p>
<p>  So he, whom, unreluctant, all obey'd.<br />
Then, wounded as they were, themselves the Kings,<br />
Tydides, Agamemnon and Ulysses<br />
Marshall'd the warriors, and from rank to rank<br />
Made just exchange of arms, giving the best<span class="lnm">460</span><br />
To the best warriors, to the worse, the worst.<br />
And now in brazen armor all array'd<br />
Refulgent on they moved, by Neptune led<br />
With firm hand grasping his long-bladed sword<br />
<span class="pgnm">354</span><a name="page_354" id="page_354"></a>
Keen as Jove's bolt; with him may none contend<span class="lnm">465</span><br />
In dreadful fight; but fear chains every arm.</p>
<p>  Opposite, Priameian Hector ranged<br />
His Trojans; then they stretch'd the bloody cord<br />
Of conflict tight, Neptune c&oelig;rulean-hair'd,<br />
And Hector, pride of Ilium; one, the Greeks<span class="lnm">470</span><br />
Supporting firm, and one, the powers of Troy;<br />
A sea-flood dash'd the galleys, and the hosts<br />
Join'd clamorous. Not so the billows roar<br />
The shores among, when Boreas' roughest blast<br />
Sweeps landward from the main the towering surge;<span class="lnm">475</span><br />
Not so, devouring fire among the trees<br />
That clothe the mountain, when the sheeted flames<br />
Ascending wrap the forest in a blaze;<br />
Nor howl the winds through leafy boughs of oaks<br />
Upgrown aloft (though loudest there they rave)<span class="lnm">480</span><br />
With sounds so awful as were heard of Greeks<br />
And Trojans shouting when the clash began.</p>
<p>  At Ajax, first (for face to face they stood)<br />
Illustrious Hector threw a spear well-aim'd,<br />
But smote him where the belts that bore his shield<span class="lnm">485</span><br />
And falchion cross'd each other on his breast.<br />
The double guard preserved him unannoy'd.<br />
Indignant that his spear had bootless flown,<br />
Yet fearing death at hand, the Trojan Chief<br />
Toward the phalanx of his friends retired.<span class="lnm">490</span><br />
But, as he went, huge Ajax with a stone<br />
Of those which propp'd the ships (for numerous such<br />
Lay rolling at the feet of those who fought)<br />
Assail'd him. Twirling like a top it pass'd<br />
The shield of Hector, near the neck his breast<span class="lnm">495</span><br />
Struck full, then plough'd circuitous the dust.<br />
As when Jove's arm omnipotent an oak<br />
Prostrates uprooted on the plain, a fume<br />
Rises sulphureous from the riven trunk,<br />
And if, perchance, some traveller nigh at hand<span class="lnm">500</span><br />
See it, he trembles at the bolt of Jove,<br />
So fell the might of Hector, to the earth<br />
<span class="pgnm">355</span><a name="page_355" id="page_355"></a>
Smitten at once. Down dropp'd his idle spear,<br />
And with his helmet and his shield himself<br />
Also; loud thunder'd all his gorgeous arms.<span class="lnm">505</span><br />
Swift flew the Grecians shouting to the skies,<br />
And showering darts, to drag his body thence,<br />
But neither spear of theirs nor shaft could harm<br />
The fallen leader, with such instant aid<br />
His princely friends encircled him around,<span class="lnm">510</span><br />
Sarpedon, Lycian Chief, Glaucus the brave,<br />
Polydamas, &AElig;neas, and renown'd<br />
Agenor; neither tardy were the rest,<br />
But with round shields all shelter'd Hector fallen.<br />
Him soon uplifted from the plain his friends<span class="lnm">515</span><br />
Bore thence, till where his fiery coursers stood,<br />
And splendid chariot in the rear, they came,<br />
Then Troy-ward drove him groaning as he went.<br />
Ere long arriving at the pleasant stream<br />
Of eddied Xanthus, progeny of Jove,<span class="lnm">520</span><br />
They laid him on the bank, and on his face<br />
Pour'd water; he, reviving, upward gazed,<br />
And seated on his hams black blood disgorged<br />
Coagulate, but soon relapsing, fell<br />
Supine, his eyes with pitchy darkness veil'd,<span class="lnm">525</span><br />
And all his powers still torpid by the blow.</p>
<p>  Then, seeing Hector borne away, the Greeks<br />
Rush'd fiercer on, all mindful of the fight,<br />
And far before the rest, Ajax the swift,<br />
The O&iuml;lean Chief, with pointed spear<span class="lnm">530</span><br />
On Satnius springing, pierced him. Him a nymph<br />
A Naiad, bore to Enops, while his herd<br />
Feeding, on Satnio's grassy verge he stray'd.<br />
But O&iuml;liades the spear-renown'd<br />
Approaching, pierced his flank; supine he fell,<span class="lnm">535</span><br />
And fiery contest for the dead arose.<br />
In vengeance of his fall, spear-shaking Chief<br />
The son of Panthus into fight advanced<br />
Polydamas, who Proth&ouml;enor pierced<br />
Offspring of Are&iuml;locus, and urged<span class="lnm">540</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">356</span><a name="page_356" id="page_356"></a>
Through his right shoulder sheer the stormy lance.<br />
He, prostrate, clench'd the dust, and with loud voice<br />
Polydamas exulted at his fall.</p>
<p>  Yon spear, methinks, hurl'd from the warlike hand<br />
Of Panthus' noble son, flew not in vain,<span class="lnm">545</span><br />
But some Greek hath it, purposing, I judge,<br />
To lean on it in his descent to hell.</p>
<p>  So he, whose vaunt the Greeks indignant heard.<br />
But most indignant, Ajax, offspring bold<br />
Of Telamon, to whom he nearest fell.<span class="lnm">550</span><br />
He, quick, at the retiring conqueror cast<br />
His radiant spear; Polydamas the stroke<br />
Shunn'd, starting sideward; but Antenor's son<br />
Archilochus the mortal dint received,<br />
Death-destined by the Gods; where neck and spine<span class="lnm">555</span><br />
Unite, both tendons he dissever'd wide,<br />
And, ere his knees, his nostrils met the ground.</p>
<p>  Then Ajax in his turn vaunting aloud<br />
Against renown'd Polydamas, exclaim'd.<br />
Speak now the truth, Polydamas, and weigh<span class="lnm">560</span><br />
My question well. His life whom I have slain<br />
Makes it not compensation for the loss<br />
Of Proth&ouml;enor's life! To me he seems<br />
Nor base himself; nor yet of base descent,<br />
But brother of Atenor steed-renown'd,<span class="lnm">565</span><br />
Or else perchance his son; for in my eyes<br />
Antenor's lineage he resembles most.</p>
<p>  So he, well knowing him, and sorrow seized<br />
Each Trojan heart. Then Acamas around<br />
His brother stalking, wounded with his spear<span class="lnm">570</span><br />
B&oelig;otian Promachus, who by the feet<br />
Dragg'd off the slain. Acamas in his fall<br />
Aloud exulted with a boundless joy.</p>
<p>  Vain-glorious Argives, archers inexpert!<br />
War's toil and trouble are not ours alone,<span class="lnm">575</span><br />
But ye shall perish also; mark the man&mdash;<br />
How sound he sleeps tamed by my conquering arm,<br />
Your fellow-warrior Promachus! the debt<br />
<span class="pgnm">357</span><a name="page_357" id="page_357"></a>
Of vengeance on my brother's dear behalf<br />
Demanded quick discharge; well may the wish<span class="lnm">580</span><br />
Of every dying warrior be to leave<br />
A brother living to avenge his fall.</p>
<p>  He ended, whom the Greeks indignant heard,<br />
But chiefly brave Peneleus; swift he rush'd<br />
On Acamas; but from before the force<span class="lnm">585</span><br />
Of King Peneleus Acamas retired,<br />
And, in his stead, Ilioneus he pierced,<br />
Offspring of Phorbas, rich in flocks; and blest<br />
By Mercury with such abundant wealth<br />
As other Trojan none, nor child to him<span class="lnm">590</span><br />
His spouse had borne, Ilioneus except.<br />
Him close beneath the brow to his eye-roots<br />
Piercing, he push'd the pupil from its seat,<br />
And through his eye and through his poll the spear<br />
Urged furious. He down-sitting on the earth<span class="lnm">595</span><br />
Both hands extended; but, his glittering blade<br />
Forth-drawn, Peneleus through his middle neck<br />
Enforced it; head and helmet to the ground<br />
He lopp'd together, with the lance infixt<br />
Still in his eye; then like a poppy's head<span class="lnm">600</span><br />
The crimson trophy lifting, in the ears<br />
He vaunted loud of Ilium's host, and cried.</p>
<p>  Go, Trojans! be my messengers! Inform<br />
The parents of Ilioneus the brave<br />
That they may mourn their son through all their house,<span class="lnm">605</span><br />
For so the wife of Alegenor's son<br />
B&oelig;otian Promachus must him bewail,<br />
Nor shall she welcome his return with smiles<br />
Of joy affectionate, when from the shores<br />
Of Troy the fleet shall bear us Grecians home.<span class="lnm">610</span></p>
<p>  He said; fear whiten'd every Trojan cheek,<br />
And every Trojan eye with earnest look<br />
Inquired a refuge from impending fate.</p>
<p>  Say now, ye Muses, blest inhabitants<br />
Of the Olympian realms! what Grecian first<span class="lnm">615</span><br />
Fill'd his victorious hand with armor stript<br />
<span class="pgnm">358</span><a name="page_358" id="page_358"></a>
From slaughter'd Trojans, after Ocean's God<br />
Had, interposing, changed the battle's course?</p>
<p>  First, Telamonian Ajax Hyrtius slew,<br />
Undaunted leader of the Mysian band.<span class="lnm">620</span><br />
Phalces and Mermerus their arms resign'd<br />
To young Antilochus; Hyppotion fell<br />
And Morys by Meriones; the shafts<br />
Right-aim'd of Teucer to the shades dismiss'd<br />
Proth&ouml;us and Periphetes, and the prince<span class="lnm">625</span><br />
Of Sparta, Menelaus, in his flank<br />
Pierced Hyperenor; on his entrails prey'd<br />
The hungry steel, and, through the gaping wound<br />
Expell'd, his spirit flew; night veil'd his eyes.<br />
But Ajax O&iuml;liades the swift<span class="lnm">630</span><br />
Slew most; him none could equal in pursuit<br />
Of tremblers scatter'd by the frown of Jove.</p>

<p class="outd">Jove, awaking and seeing the Trojans routed, threatens Juno. He sends
Iris to admonish Neptune to relinquish the battle, and Apollo to restore
health to Hector. Apollo armed with the &AElig;gis, puts to flight the Grecians;

<div class="poem">
<p class="noind">But when the flying Trojans had o'erpass'd<br />
Both stakes and trench, and numerous slaughtered lay<br />
By Grecian hands, the remnant halted all<br />
Beside their chariots, pale, discomfited.<br />
Then was it that on Ida's summit Jove<span class="lnm">5</span><br />
At Juno's side awoke; starting, he stood<br />
At once erect; Trojans and Greeks he saw,<br />
These broken, those pursuing and led on<br />
By Neptune; he beheld also remote<br />
Encircled by his friends, and on the plain<span class="lnm">10</span><br />
Extended, Hector; there he panting lay,<br />
Senseless, ejecting blood, bruised by a blow<br />
From not the feeblest of the sons of Greece.<br />
Touch'd with compassion at that sight, the Sire<br />
Of Gods and men, frowning terrific, fix'd<span class="lnm">15</span><br />
His eyes on Juno, and her thus bespake.</p>
<p>  No place for doubt remains. Oh, versed in wiles,<br />
Juno! thy mischief-teeming mind perverse<br />
Hath plotted this; thou hast contrived the hurt<br />
Of Hector, and hast driven his host to flight.<span class="lnm">20</span><br />
I know not but thyself mayst chance to reap<br />
The first-fruits of thy cunning, scourged<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_15-1">[1]</a> by me.<br />
<span class="pgnm">362</span><a name="page_362" id="page_362"></a>
Hast thou forgotten how I once aloft<br />
Suspended thee, with anvils at thy feet,<br />
And both thy wrists bound with a golden cord<span class="lnm">25</span><br />
Indissoluble? In the clouds of heaven<br />
I hung thee, while from the Olympian heights<br />
The Gods look'd mournful on, but of them all<br />
None could deliver thee, for whom I seized,<br />
Hurl'd through the gates of heaven on earth he fell,<span class="lnm">30</span><br />
Half-breathless. Neither so did I resign<br />
My hot resentment of the hero's wrongs<br />
Immortal Hercules, whom thou by storms<br />
Call'd from the North, with mischievous intent<br />
Hadst driven far distant o'er the barren Deep<span class="lnm">35</span><br />
To populous Cos. Thence I deliver'd him,<br />
And after numerous woes severe, he reach'd<br />
The shores of fruitful Argos, saved by me.<br />
I thus remind thee now, that thou mayst cease<br />
Henceforth from artifice, and mayst be taught<span class="lnm">40</span><br />
How little all the dalliance and the love<br />
Which, stealing down from heaven, thou hast by fraud<br />
Obtain'd from me, shall profit thee at last.</p>
<p>  He ended, whom imperial Juno heard<br />
Shuddering, and in wing'd accents thus replied.<span class="lnm">45</span></p>
<p>  Be witness Earth, the boundless Heaven above,<br />
And Styx beneath, whose stream the blessed Gods<br />
Even tremble to adjure;<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_15-2">[2]</a> be witness too<br />
Thy sacred life, and our connubial bed,<br />
Which by a false oath I will never wrong,<span class="lnm">50</span><br />
That by no art induced or plot of mine<br />
Neptune, the Shaker of the shores, inflicts<br />
<span class="pgnm">363</span><a name="page_363" id="page_363"></a>
These harms on Hector and the Trojan host<br />
Aiding the Grecians, but impell'd alone<br />
By his own heart with pity moved at sight<span class="lnm">55</span><br />
Of the Achaians at the ships subdued.<br />
But even him, oh Sovereign of the storms!<br />
I am prepared to admonish that he quit<br />
The battle, and retire where thou command'st.</p>
<p>  So she; then smiled the Sire of Gods and men,<span class="lnm">60</span><br />
And in wing'd accents answer thus return'd.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_15-3">[3]</a></p>
<p>  Juno! wouldst thou on thy celestial throne<br />
Assist my counsels, howso'er in heart<br />
He differ now, Neptune should soon his will<br />
Submissive bend to thy desires and mine.<span class="lnm">65</span><br />
But if sincerity be in thy words<br />
And truth, repairing to the blest abodes<br />
Send Iris hither, with the archer God<br />
Apollo; that she, visiting the host<br />
Of Greece, may bid the Sovereign of the Deep<span class="lnm">70</span><br />
Renounce the fight, and seek his proper home.<br />
Apollo's part shall be to rouse again<br />
Hector to battle, to inspire his soul<br />
Afresh with courage, and all memory thence<br />
To banish of the pangs which now he feels.<span class="lnm">75</span><br />
Apollo also shall again repulse<br />
Achaia's host, which with base panic fill'd,<br />
Shall even to Achilles' ships be driven.<br />
Achilles shall his valiant friend exhort<br />
Patroclus forth; him under Ilium's walls<span class="lnm">80</span><br />
Shall glorious Hector slay; but many a youth<br />
Shall perish by Patroclus first, with whom,<br />
My noble son Sarpedon. Peleus' son,<br />
Resentful of Patroclus' death, shall slay<br />
Hector, and I will urge ceaseless, myself,<span class="lnm">85</span><br />
Thenceforth the routed Trojans back again,<br />
Till by Minerva's aid the Greeks shall take<br />
Ilium's proud city; till that day arrive<br />
My wrath shall burn, nor will I one permit<br />
<span class="pgnm">364</span><a name="page_364" id="page_364"></a>
Of all the Immortals to assist the Greeks,<span class="lnm">90</span><br />
But will perform Achilles' whole desire.<br />
Such was my promise to him at the first,<br />
Ratified by a nod that self-same day<br />
When Thetis clasp'd my knees, begging revenge<br />
And glory for her city-spoiler son.<span class="lnm">95</span></p>
<p>  He ended; nor his spouse white-arm'd refused<br />
Obedience, but from the Id&aelig;an heights<br />
Departing, to the Olympian summit soar'd.<br />
Swift as the traveller's thought,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_15-4">[4]</a> who, many a land<br />
Traversed, deliberates on his future course<span class="lnm">100</span><br />
Uncertain, and his mind sends every way,<br />
So swift updarted Juno to the skies.<br />
Arrived on the Olympian heights, she found<br />
The Gods assembled; they, at once, their seats<br />
At her approach forsaking, with full cups<span class="lnm">105</span><br />
Her coming hail'd; heedless of all beside,<br />
She took the cup from blooming Themis' hand,<br />
For she first flew to welcome her, and thus<br />
In accents wing'd of her return inquired.</p>
<p>  Say, Juno, why this sudden re-ascent?<span class="lnm">110</span><br />
Thou seem'st dismay'd; hath Saturn's son, thy spouse,<br />
Driven thee affrighted to the skies again?</p>
<p>  To whom the white-arm'd Goddess thus replied.<br />
Themis divine, ask not. Full well thou know'st<br />
How harshly temper'd is the mind of Jove,<span class="lnm">115</span><br />
And how untractable. Resume thy seat;<br />
The banquet calls thee; at our board preside,<br />
Thou shalt be told, and all in heaven shall hear<br />
What ills he threatens; such as shall not leave<br />
All minds at ease, I judge, here or on earth,<span class="lnm">120</span><br />
However tranquil some and joyous now.</p>
<p>  So spake the awful spouse of Jove, and sat.<br />
Then, all alike, the Gods displeasure felt<br />
<span class="pgnm">365</span><a name="page_365" id="page_365"></a>
Throughout the courts of Jove, but she, her lips<br />
Gracing with smiles from which her sable brows<span class="lnm">125</span><br />
Dissented,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_15-5">[5]</a> thus indignant them address'd.</p>
<p>  Alas! how vain against the Thunderer's will<br />
Our anger, and the hope to supersede<br />
His purpose, by persuasion or by force!<br />
He solitary sits, all unconcern'd<span class="lnm">130</span><br />
At our resentment, and himself proclaims<br />
Mightiest and most to be revered in heaven.<br />
Be patient, therefore, and let each endure<br />
Such ills as Jove may send him. Mars, I ween,<br />
Already hath his share; the warrior God<span class="lnm">135</span><br />
Hath lost Ascalaphus, of all mankind<br />
His most beloved, and whom he calls his own.</p>
<p>  She spake, and with expanded palms his thighs<br />
Smiling, thus, sorrowful, the God exclaim'd.</p>
<p>  Inhabitants of the Olympian heights!<span class="lnm">140</span><br />
Oh bear with me, if to avenge my son<br />
I seek Achaia's fleet, although my doom<br />
Be thunder-bolts from Jove, and with the dead<br />
Outstretch'd to lie in carnage and in dust.</p>
<p>  He spake, and bidding Horror and Dismay<span class="lnm">145</span><br />
Lead to the yoke his rapid steeds, put on<br />
His all-refulgent armor. Then had wrath<br />
More dreadful, some strange vengeance on the Gods<br />
From Jove befallen, had not Minerva, touch'd<br />
With timely fears for all, upstarting sprung<span class="lnm">150</span><br />
From where she sat, right through the vestibule.<br />
She snatch'd the helmet from his brows, the shield<br />
From his broad shoulder, and the brazen spear<br />
Forced from his grasp into its place restored.<br />
Then reprimanding Mars, she thus began.<span class="lnm">155</span></p>
<p>  Frantic, delirious! thou art lost for ever!<br />
Is it in vain that thou hast ears to hear,<br />
And hast thou neither shame nor reason left?<br />
<span class="pgnm">366</span><a name="page_366" id="page_366"></a>
How? hear'st thou not the Goddess? the report<br />
Of white-arm'd Juno from Olympian Jove<span class="lnm">160</span><br />
Return'd this moment? or perfer'st thou rather,<br />
Plagued with a thousand woes, and under force<br />
Of sad necessity to seek again<br />
Olympus, and at thy return to prove<br />
Author of countless miseries to us all?<span class="lnm">165</span><br />
For He at once Grecians and Trojans both<br />
Abandoning, will hither haste prepared<br />
To tempest<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_15-6">[6]</a> us in heaven, whom he will seize,<br />
The guilty and the guiltless, all alike.<br />
I bid thee, therefore, patient bear the death<span class="lnm">170</span><br />
Of thy Ascalaphus; braver than he<br />
And abler have, ere now, in battle fallen,<br />
And shall hereafter; arduous were the task<br />
To rescue from the stroke of fate the race<br />
Of mortal men, with all their progeny.<span class="lnm">175</span></p>
<p>  So saying, Minerva on his throne replaced<br />
The fiery Mars. Then, summoning abroad<br />
Apollo from within the hall of Jove,<br />
With Iris, swift ambassadress of heaven,<br />
Them in wing'd accents Juno thus bespake.<span class="lnm">180</span></p>
<p>  Jove bids you hence with undelaying speed<br />
To Ida; in his presence once arrived,<br />
See that ye execute his whole command.</p>
<p>  So saying, the awful Goddess to her throne<br />
Return'd and sat. They, cleaving swift the air,<span class="lnm">185</span><br />
Alighted soon on Ida fountain-fed,<br />
Parent of savage kinds. High on the point<br />
Seated of Gargarus, and wrapt around<br />
With fragrant clouds, they found Saturnian Jove<br />
The Thunderer, and in his presence stood.<span class="lnm">190</span><br />
He, nought displeased that they his high command<br />
<span class="pgnm">367</span><a name="page_367" id="page_367"></a>
Had with such readiness obey'd, his speech<br />
To Iris, first, in accents wing'd address'd</p>
<p>  Swift Iris, haste&mdash;to royal Neptune bear<br />
My charge entire; falsify not the word.<span class="lnm">195</span><br />
Bid him, relinquishing the fight, withdraw<br />
Either to heaven, or to the boundless Deep.<br />
But should he disobedient prove, and scorn<br />
My message, let him, next, consider well<br />
How he will bear, powerful as he is,<span class="lnm">200</span><br />
My coming. Me I boast superior far<br />
In force, and elder-born; yet deems he slight<br />
The danger of comparison with me,<br />
Who am the terror of all heaven beside.</p>
<p>  He spake, nor storm-wing'd Iris disobey'd,<span class="lnm">205</span><br />
But down from the Id&aelig;an summit stoop'd<br />
To sacred Ilium. As when snow or hail<br />
Flies drifted by the cloud-dispelling North,<br />
So swiftly, wing'd with readiness of will,<br />
She shot the gulf between, and standing soon<span class="lnm">210</span><br />
At glorious Neptune's side, him thus address'd.</p>
<p>  To thee, O Neptune azure-hair'd! I come<br />
With tidings charged from &AElig;gis-bearing Jove.<br />
He bids thee cease from battle, and retire<br />
Either to heaven, or to the boundless Deep.<span class="lnm">215</span><br />
But shouldst thou, disobedient, set at nought<br />
His words, he threatens that himself will haste<br />
To fight against thee; but he bids thee shun<br />
That strife with one superior far to thee,<br />
And elder-born; yet deem'st thou slight, he saith,<span class="lnm">220</span><br />
The danger of comparison with Him,<br />
Although the terror of all heaven beside.</p>
<p>  Her then the mighty Shaker of the shores<br />
Answer'd indignant. Great as is his power,<br />
Yet he hath spoken proudly, threatening me<span class="lnm">225</span><br />
With force, high-born and glorious as himself.<br />
We are three brothers; Saturn is our sire,<br />
And Rhea brought us forth; first, Jove she bore;<br />
Me next; then, Pluto, Sovereign of the shades.<br />
<span class="pgnm">368</span><a name="page_368" id="page_368"></a>
By distribution tripart we received<span class="lnm">230</span><br />
Each his peculiar honors; me the lots<br />
Made Ruler of the hoary floods, and there<br />
I dwell for ever. Pluto, for his part,<br />
The regions took of darkness; and the heavens,<br />
The clouds, and boundless &aelig;ther, fell to Jove.<span class="lnm">235</span><br />
The Earth and the Olympian heights alike<br />
Are common to the three. My life and being<br />
I hold not, therefore, at his will, whose best<br />
And safest course, with all his boasted power,<br />
Were to possess in peace his proper third.<span class="lnm">240</span><br />
Let him not seek to terrify with force<br />
Me like a dastard; let him rather chide<br />
His own-begotten; with big-sounding words<br />
His sons and daughters govern, who perforce<br />
Obey his voice, and shrink at his commands.<span class="lnm">245</span></p>
<p>  To whom thus Iris tempest-wing'd replied,<br />
C&oelig;rulean-tress'd Sovereign of the Deep!<br />
Shall I report to Jove, harsh as it is,<br />
Thy speech, or wilt thou soften it? The wise<br />
Are flexible, and on the elder-born<span class="lnm">250</span><br />
Erynnis, with her vengeful sisters, waits.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_15-7">[7]</a></p>
<p>  Her answer'd then the Shaker of the shores.<br />
Prudent is thy advice, Iris divine!<br />
Discretion in a messenger is good<br />
At all times. But the cause that fires me thus,<span class="lnm">255</span><br />
And with resentment my whole heart and mind<br />
Possesses, is the license that he claims<br />
To vex with provocation rude of speech<br />
Me his compeer, and by decree of Fate<br />
Illustrious as himself; yet, though incensed,<span class="lnm">260</span><br />
And with just cause, I will not now persist.<br />
But hear&mdash;for it is treasured in my heart<br />
The threat that my lips utter. If he still<br />
<span class="pgnm">369</span><a name="page_369" id="page_369"></a>
Resolve to spare proud Ilium in despite<br />
Of me, of Pallas, Goddess of the spoils,<span class="lnm">265</span><br />
Of Juno, Mercury, and the King of fire,<br />
And will not overturn her lofty towers,<br />
Nor grant immortal glory to the Greeks,<br />
Then tell him thus&mdash;hostility shall burn,<br />
And wrath between us never to be quench'd.<span class="lnm">270</span></p>
<p>  So saying, the Shaker of the shores forsook<br />
The Grecian host, and plunged into the deep,<br />
Miss'd by Achaia's heroes. Then, the cloud-Assembler<br />
God thus to Apollo spake.</p>
<p>  Hence, my Apollo! to the Trojan Chief<span class="lnm">275</span><br />
Hector; for earth-encircler Neptune, awed<br />
By fear of my displeasure imminent,<br />
Hath sought the sacred Deep. Else, all the Gods<br />
Who compass Saturn in the nether realms,<br />
Had even there our contest heard, I ween,<span class="lnm">280</span><br />
And heard it loudly. But that he retreats<br />
Although at first incensed, shunning my wrath,<br />
Is salutary both for him and me,<br />
Whose difference else had not been healed with ease.<br />
Take thou my shaggy &AElig;gis, and with force<span class="lnm">285</span><br />
Smiting it, terrify the Chiefs of Greece.<br />
As for illustrious Hector, him I give<br />
To thy peculiar care; fail not to rouse<br />
His fiercest courage, till he push the Greeks<br />
To Hellespont, and to their ships again;<span class="lnm">290</span><br />
Thenceforth to yield to their afflicted host<br />
Some pause from toil, shall be my own concern.</p>
<p>  He ended, nor Apollo disobey'd<br />
His father's voice; from the Id&aelig;an heights,<br />
Swift as the swiftest of the fowls of air,<span class="lnm">295</span><br />
The dove-destroyer falcon, down he flew.<br />
The noble Hector, valiant Priam's son<br />
He found, not now extended on the plain,<br />
But seated; newly, as from death, awaked,<br />
And conscious of his friends; freely he breathed<span class="lnm">300</span><br />
Nor sweated more, by Jove himself revived.<br />
<span class="pgnm">370</span><a name="page_370" id="page_370"></a>
Apollo stood beside him, and began.</p>
<p>  Say, Hector, Priam's son! why sittest here<br />
Feeble and spiritless, and from thy host<br />
Apart? what new disaster hath befall'n?<span class="lnm">305</span></p>
<p>  To whom with difficulty thus replied<br />
The warlike Chief.&mdash;But tell me who art Thou,<br />
Divine inquirer! best of powers above!<br />
Know'st not that dauntless Ajax me his friends<br />
Slaughtering at yonder ships, hath with a stone<span class="lnm">310</span><br />
Surceased from fight, smiting me on the breast?<br />
I thought to have beheld, this day, the dead<br />
In Ades, every breath so seem'd my last.</p>
<p>  Then answer thus the Archer-God return'd.<br />
Courage this moment! such a helper Jove<span class="lnm">315</span><br />
From Ida sends thee at thy side to war<br />
Continual, Ph&oelig;bus of the golden sword,<br />
Whose guardian aid both thee and lofty Troy<br />
Hath succor'd many a time. Therefore arise!<br />
Instant bid drive thy numerous charioteers<span class="lnm">320</span><br />
Their rapid steeds full on the Grecian fleet;<br />
I, marching at their head, will smooth, myself,<br />
The way before them, and will turn again<br />
To flight the heroes of the host of Greece.</p>
<p>  He said and with new strength the Chief inspired.<span class="lnm">325</span><br />
As some stall'd horse high pamper'd, snapping short<br />
His cord, beats under foot the sounding soil,<br />
Accustom'd in smooth-sliding streams to lave<br />
Exulting; high he bears his head, his mane<br />
Wantons around his shoulders; pleased, he eyes<span class="lnm">330</span><br />
His glossy sides, and borne on pliant knees<br />
Soon finds the haunts where all his fellows graze;<br />
So bounded Hector, and his agile joints<br />
Plied lightly, quicken'd by the voice divine,<br />
And gather'd fast his charioteers to battle.<span class="lnm">335</span><br />
But as when hounds and hunters through the woods<br />
Rush in pursuit of stag or of wild goat,<br />
He, in some cave with tangled boughs o'erhung,<br />
Lies safe conceal'd, no destined prey of theirs,<br />
<span class="pgnm">371</span><a name="page_371" id="page_371"></a>
Till by their clamors roused, a lion grim<span class="lnm">340</span><br />
Starts forth to meet them; then, the boldest fly;<br />
Such hot pursuit the Dana&iuml;, with swords<br />
And spears of double edge long time maintain'd.<br />
But seeing Hector in his ranks again<br />
Occupied, felt at once their courage fall'n.<span class="lnm">345</span></p>
<p>  Then, Thoas them, Andr&aelig;mon's son, address'd,<br />
Foremost of the &AElig;tolians, at the spear<br />
Skilful, in stationary combat bold,<br />
And when the sons of Greece held in dispute<br />
The prize of eloquence, excell'd by few.<span class="lnm">350</span><br />
Prudent advising them, he thus began.</p>
<p>  Ye Gods! what prodigy do I behold?<br />
Hath Hector, 'scaping death, risen again?<br />
For him, with confident persuasion all<br />
Believed by Telamonian Ajax slain.<span class="lnm">355</span><br />
But some Divinity hath interposed<br />
To rescue and save Hector, who the joints<br />
Hath stiffen'd of full many a valiant Greek,<br />
As surely now he shall; for, not without<br />
The Thunderer's aid, he flames in front again.<span class="lnm">360</span><br />
But take ye all my counsel. Send we back<br />
The multitude into the fleet, and first<br />
Let us, who boast ourselves bravest in fight,<br />
Stand, that encountering him with lifted spears,<br />
We may attempt to give his rage a check.<span class="lnm">365</span><br />
To thrust himself into a band like ours<br />
Will, doubtless, even in Hector move a fear.</p>
<p>  He ceased, with whose advice all, glad, complied.<br />
Then Ajax with Idomeneus of Crete,<br />
Teucer, Meriones, and Meges fierce<span class="lnm">370</span><br />
As Mars in battle, summoning aloud<br />
The noblest Greeks, in opposition firm<br />
To Hector and his host their bands prepared,<br />
While others all into the fleet retired.<br />
Troy's crowded host<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_15-8">[8]</a> struck first. With awful strides<span class="lnm">375</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">372</span><a name="page_372" id="page_372"></a>
Came Hector foremost; him Apollo led,<br />
His shoulders wrapt in clouds, and, on his arm,<br />
The &AElig;gis shagg'd terrific all around,<br />
Tempestuous, dazzling-bright; it was a gift<br />
To Jove from Vulcan, and design'd to appall,<span class="lnm">380</span><br />
And drive to flight the armies of the earth.<br />
Arm'd with that shield Apollo led them on.<br />
Firm stood the embodied Greeks; from either host<br />
Shrill cries arose; the arrows from the nerve<br />
Leap'd, and, by vigorous arms dismiss'd, the spears<span class="lnm">385</span><br />
Flew frequent; in the flesh some stood infixt<br />
Of warlike youths, but many, ere they reach'd<br />
The mark they coveted, unsated fell<br />
Between the hosts, and rested in the soil.<br />
Long as the God unagitated held<span class="lnm">390</span><br />
The dreadful disk, so long the vollied darts<br />
Made mutual slaughter, and the people fell;<br />
But when he look'd the Grecian charioteers<br />
Full in the face and shook it, raising high<br />
Himself the shout of battle, then he quell'd<span class="lnm">395</span><br />
Their spirits, then he struck from every mind<br />
At once all memory of their might in arms.<br />
As when two lions in the still, dark night<br />
A herd of beeves scatter or numerous flock<br />
Suddenly, in the absence of the guard,<span class="lnm">400</span><br />
So fled the heartless Greeks, for Ph&oelig;bus sent<br />
Terrors among them, but renown conferr'd<br />
And triumph proud on Hector and his host.<br />
Then, in that foul disorder of the field,<br />
Man singled man. Arcesila&uuml;s died<span class="lnm">405</span><br />
By Hector's arm, and Stichius; one, a Chief<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_15-9">[9]</a><br />
Of the B&oelig;otians brazen-mail'd, and one,<br />
Menestheus' faithful follower to the fight.<br />
&AElig;neas Medon and I&auml;sus slew.<br />
Medon was spurious offspring of divine<span class="lnm">410</span><br />
O&iuml;leus Ajax' father, and abode<br />
In Phylace; for he had slain a Chief<br />
<span class="pgnm">373</span><a name="page_373" id="page_373"></a>
Brother of Eriopis the espoused<br />
Of brave O&iuml;leus; but I&auml;sus led<br />
A phalanx of Athenians, and the son<span class="lnm">415</span><br />
Of Sphelus, son of Bucolus was deem'd.<br />
Pierced by Polydamas Mecisteus fell,<br />
Polites, in the van of battle, slew<br />
Echion, and Agenor Clonius;<br />
But Paris, while De&iuml;ochus to flight<span class="lnm">420</span><br />
Turn'd with the routed van, pierced him beneath<br />
His shoulder-blade, and urged the weapon through.</p>
<p>  While them the Trojans spoil'd, meantime the Greeks,<br />
Entangled in the piles of the deep foss,<br />
Fled every way, and through necessity<span class="lnm">425</span><br />
Repass'd the wall. Then Hector with a voice<br />
Of loud command bade every Trojan cease<br />
From spoil, and rush impetuous on the fleet.<br />
<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_15-10">[10]</a>And whom I find far lingering from the ships<br />
Wherever, there he dies; no funeral fires<span class="lnm">430</span><br />
Brother on him, or sister, shall bestow,<br />
But dogs shall rend him in the sight of Troy.</p>
<p>  So saying, he lash'd the shoulders of his steeds,<br />
And through the ranks vociferating, call'd<br />
His Trojans on; they, clamorous as he,<span class="lnm">435</span><br />
All lash'd their steeds, and menacing, advanced.<br />
Before them with his feet Apollo push'd<br />
The banks into the foss, bridging the gulf<br />
With pass commodious, both in length and breadth<br />
A lance's flight, for proof of vigor hurl'd.<span class="lnm">440</span><br />
There, phalanx after phalanx, they their host<br />
Pour'd dense along, while Ph&oelig;bus in the van<br />
Display'd the awful &aelig;gis, and the wall<br />
Levell'd with ease divine. As, on the shore<br />
Some wanton boy with sand builds plaything walls,<span class="lnm">445</span><br />
Then, sportive spreads them with his feet abroad,<br />
So thou, shaft-arm'd Apollo! that huge work<br />
Laborious of the Greeks didst turn with ease<br />
<span class="pgnm">374</span><a name="page_374" id="page_374"></a>
To ruin, and themselves drovest all to flight.<br />
They, thus enforced into the fleet, again<span class="lnm">450</span><br />
Stood fast, with mutual exhortation each<br />
His friend encouraging, and all the Gods<br />
With lifted hands soliciting aloud.<br />
But, more than all, Gerenian Nestor pray'd<br />
Fervent, Achaia's guardian, and with arms<span class="lnm">455</span><br />
Outstretch'd toward the starry skies, exclaim'd.</p>
<p>  Jove, Father! if in corn-clad Argos, one,<br />
One Greek hath ever, burning at thy shrine<br />
Fat thighs of sheep or oxen, ask'd from thee<br />
A safe return, whom thou hast gracious heard,<span class="lnm">460</span><br />
Olympian King! and promised what he sought,<br />
Now, in remembrance of it, give us help<br />
In this disastrous day, nor thus permit<br />
Their Trojan foes to tread the Grecians down!</p>
<p>  So Nestor pray'd, and Jove thunder'd aloud<span class="lnm">465</span><br />
Responsive to the old Nele&iuml;an's prayer.<br />
But when that voice of &AElig;gis-bearing Jove<br />
The Trojans heard, more furious on the Greeks<br />
They sprang, all mindful of the fight. As when<br />
A turgid billow of some spacious sea,<span class="lnm">470</span><br />
While the wind blow that heaves its highest, borne<br />
Sheer o'er the vessel's side, rolls into her,<br />
With such loud roar the Trojans pass'd the wall;<br />
In rush'd the steeds, and at the ships they waged<br />
Fierce battle hand to hand, from chariots, these,<span class="lnm">475</span><br />
With spears of double edge, those, from the decks<br />
Of many a sable bark, with naval poles<br />
Long, ponderous, shod with steel; for every ship<br />
Had such, for conflict maritime prepared.</p>
<p>  While yet the battle raged only without<span class="lnm">480</span><br />
The wall, and from the ships apart, so long<br />
Patroclus quiet in the tent and calm<br />
Sat of Eurypylus, his generous friend<br />
Consoling with sweet converse, and his wound<br />
Sprinkling with drugs assuasive of his pains.<span class="lnm">485</span><br />
But soon as through the broken rampart borne<br />
<span class="pgnm">375</span><a name="page_375" id="page_375"></a>
He saw the Trojans, and the clamor heard<br />
And tumult of the flying Greeks, a voice<br />
Of loud lament uttering, with open palms<br />
His thighs he smote, and, sorrowful, exclaim'd.<span class="lnm">490</span></p>
<p>  Eurypylus! although thy need be great,<br />
No longer may I now sit at thy side,<br />
Such contest hath arisen; thy servant's voice<br />
Must soothe thee now, for I will to the tent<br />
Haste of Achilles, and exhort him forth;<span class="lnm">495</span><br />
Who knows? if such the pleasure of the Gods,<br />
I may prevail; friends rarely plead in vain.</p>
<p>  So saying, he went. Meantime the Greeks endured<br />
The Trojan onset, firm, yet from the ships<br />
Repulsed them not, though fewer than themselves,<span class="lnm">500</span><br />
Nor could the host of Troy, breaking the ranks<br />
Of Greece, mix either with the camp or fleet;<br />
But as the line divides the plank aright,<br />
Stretch'd by some naval architect, whose hand<br />
Minerva hath accomplish'd in his art,<span class="lnm">505</span><br />
So stretch'd on them the cord of battle lay.<br />
Others at other ships the conflict waged,<br />
But Hector to the ship advanced direct<br />
Of glorious Ajax; for one ship they strove;<br />
Nor Hector, him dislodging thence, could fire<span class="lnm">510</span><br />
The fleet, nor Ajax from the fleet repulse<br />
Hector, conducted thither by the Gods.<br />
Then, noble Ajax with a spear the breast<br />
Pierced of Caletor, son of Clytius, arm'd<br />
With fire to burn his bark; sounding he fell,<span class="lnm">515</span><br />
And from his loosen'd grasp down dropp'd the brand.<br />
But Hector seeing his own kinsman fallen<br />
Beneath the sable bark, with mighty voice<br />
Call'd on the hosts of Lycia and of Troy.</p>
<p>  Trojans and Lycians, and close-fighting sons<span class="lnm">520</span><br />
Of Dardanus, within this narrow pass<br />
Stand firm, retreat not, but redeem the son<br />
Of Clytius, lest the Grecians of his arms<br />
Despoil him slain in battle at the ships.</p>
<p><span class="pgnm">376</span><a name="page_376" id="page_376"></a>
  So saying, at Ajax his bright spear he cast<span class="lnm">525</span><br />
Him pierced he not, but Lycophron the son<br />
Of Mastor, a Cytherian, who had left<br />
Cytheras, fugitive for blood, and dwelt<br />
With Ajax. Him standing at Ajax' side,<br />
He pierced above his ear; down from the stern<span class="lnm">530</span><br />
Supine he fell, and in the dust expired.<br />
Then, shuddering, Ajax to his brother spake.</p>
<p>  Alas, my Teucer! we have lost our friend;<br />
Mastorides is slain, whom we received<br />
An inmate from Cyther&aelig;, and with love<span class="lnm">535</span><br />
And reverence even filia,, entertain'd;<br />
B9 Hector pierced, he dies. Where are thy shafts<br />
Death-wing'd, and bow, by gift from Ph&oelig;bus thine?</p>
<p>  He said, whom Teucer hearing, instant ran<br />
With bow and well-stored quiver to his side,<span class="lnm">540</span><br />
Whence soon his arrows sought the Trojan host.<br />
He struck Pisenor's son Clytus, the friend<br />
And charioteer of brave Polydamas,<br />
Offspring of Panthus, toiling with both hands<br />
To rule his fiery steeds; for more to please<span class="lnm">545</span><br />
The Trojans and their Chief, where stormy most<br />
He saw the battle, thither he had driven.<br />
But sudden mischief, valiant as he was,<br />
Found him, and such as none could waft aside,<br />
For right into his neck the arrow plunged,<span class="lnm">550</span><br />
And down he fell; his startled coursers shook<br />
Their trappings, and the empty chariot rang.<br />
That sound alarm'd Polydamas; he turn'd,<br />
And flying to their heads, consign'd them o'er<br />
To Protia&ouml;n's son, Astyno&uuml;s,<span class="lnm">555</span><br />
Whom he enjoin'd to keep them in his view;<br />
Then, turning, mingled with the van again.<br />
But Teucer still another shaft produced<br />
Design'd for valiant Hector, whose exploits<br />
(Had that shaft reach'd him) at the ships of Greece<span class="lnm">560</span><br />
Had ceased for ever. But the eye of Jove,<br />
Guardian of Hector's life, slept not; he took<br />
<span class="pgnm">377</span><a name="page_377" id="page_377"></a>
From Telamonian Te5cer that renown,<br />
And while he stood straining the twisted nerve<br />
Against the Trojan, snapp'd it. Devious flew<span class="lnm">565</span><br />
The steel-charged<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_15-11">[11]</a> arrow, and he dropp'd his bow.<br />
Then shuddering, to his brother thus he spake.</p>
<p>  Ah! it is evident. Some Power divine<br />
Makes fruitless all our efforts, who hath struck<br />
My bow out of my hand, and snapt the cord<span class="lnm">570</span><br />
With which I strung it new at dawn of day,<br />
That it might bear the bound of many a shaft.</p>
<p>  To whom the towering son of Telamon.<br />
Leave then thy bow, and let thine arrows rest,<br />
Which, envious of the Greeks, some God confounds,<span class="lnm">575</span><br />
That thou may'st fight with spear and buckler arm'd,<br />
And animate the rest. Such be our deeds<br />
That, should they conquer us, our foes may find<br />
Our ships, at least a prize not lightly won.</p>
<p>  So Ajax spake; then Teucer, in his tent<span class="lnm">580</span><br />
The bow replacing, slung his fourfold shield,<br />
Settled on his illustrious brows his casque<br />
With hair high-crested, waving, as he moved,<br />
Terrible from above, took forth a spear<br />
Tough-grain'd, acuminated sharp with brass,<span class="lnm">585</span><br />
And stood, incontinent, at Ajax' side.<br />
Hector perceived the change, and of the cause<br />
Conscious, with echoing voice call'd to his host.</p>
<p>  Trojans and Lycians and close-fighting sons<br />
Of Dardanus, oh now, my friends, be men;<span class="lnm">590</span><br />
Now, wheresoever through the fleet dispersed,<br />
Call into mind the fury of your might!<br />
For I have seen, myself, Jove rendering vain<br />
The arrows of their mightiest. Man may know<br />
With ease the hand of interposing Jove,<span class="lnm">595</span><br />
Both whom to glory he ordains, and whom<br />
He weakens and aids not; so now he leaves<br />
<span class="pgnm">378</span><a name="page_378" id="page_378"></a>
The Grecians, but propitious smiles on us.<br />
Therefore stand fast, and whosoever gall'd<br />
By arrow or by spear, dies&mdash;let him die;<span class="lnm">600</span><br />
It shall not shame him that he died to serve<br />
His country,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_15-12">[12]</a> but his children, wife and home,<br />
With all his heritage, shall be secure,<br />
Drive but the Grecians from the shores of Troy.</p>
<p>  So saying, he animated each. Meantime,<span class="lnm">605</span><br />
Ajax his fellow-warriors thus address'd.</p>
<p>  Shame on you all! Now, Grecians, either die,<br />
Or save at once your galley and yourselves.<br />
Hope ye, that should your ships become the prize<br />
Of warlike Hector, ye shall yet return<span class="lnm">610</span><br />
On foot? Or hear ye not the Chief aloud<br />
Summoning all his host, and publishing<br />
His own heart's wish to burn your fleet with fire?<br />
Not to a dance, believe me, but to fight<br />
He calls them; therefore wiser course for us<span class="lnm">615</span><br />
Is none, than that we mingle hands with hands<br />
In contest obstinate, and force with force.<br />
Better at once to perish, or at once<br />
To rescue life, than to consume the time<br />
Hour after hour in lingering conflict vain<span class="lnm">620</span><br />
Here at the ships, with an inferior foe.</p>
<p>  He said, and by his words into all hearts<br />
Fresh confidence infused. Then Hector smote<br />
Schedius, a Chief of the Phocensian powers<br />
And son of Perimedes; Ajax slew,<span class="lnm">625</span><br />
Meantime, a Chief of Trojan infantry,<br />
<span class="pgnm">379</span><a name="page_379" id="page_379"></a>
Laodamas, Antenor's noble son<br />
While by Polydamas, a leader bold<br />
Of the Epeans, and Phylides'<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_15-13">[13]</a> friend,<br />
Cyllenian Otus died. Meges that sight<span class="lnm">630</span><br />
Viewing indignant on the conqueror sprang,<br />
But, starting wide, Polydamas escaped,<br />
Saved by Apollo, and his spear transpierced<br />
The breast of Cr&aelig;smus; on his sounding shield<br />
Prostrate he fell, and Meges stripp'd his arms.<span class="lnm">635</span><br />
Him so employ'd Dolops assail'd, brave son<br />
Of Lampus, best of men and bold in fight,<br />
Offspring of King Laomedon; he stood<br />
Full near, and through his middle buckler struck<br />
The son of Phyleus, but his corselet thick<span class="lnm">640</span><br />
With plates of scaly brass his life secured.<br />
That corselet Phyleus on a time brought home<br />
From Ephyre, where the Selle&iuml;s winds,<br />
And it was given him for his life's defence<br />
In furious battle by the King of men,<span class="lnm">645</span><br />
Euphetes. Many a time had it preserved<br />
Unharm'd the sire, and now it saved the son.<br />
Then Meges, rising, with his pointed lance<br />
The bushy crest of Dolops' helmet drove<br />
Sheer from its base; new-tinged with purple bright<span class="lnm">650</span><br />
Entire it fell and mingled with the dust.<br />
While thus they strove, each hoping victory,<br />
Came martial Menelaus to the aid<br />
Of Meges; spear in hand apart he stood<br />
By Dolops unperceived, through his back drove<span class="lnm">655</span><br />
And through his breast the spear, and far beyond.<br />
And down fell Dolops, forehead to the ground.<br />
At once both flew to strip his radiant arms,<br />
Then, Hector summoning his kindred, call'd<br />
Each to his aid, and Melanippus first,<span class="lnm">660</span><br />
Illustrious Hicetaon's son, reproved.<br />
Ere yet the enemies of Troy arrived<br />
He in Percote fed his wandering beeves;<br />
<span class="pgnm">380</span><a name="page_380" id="page_380"></a>
But when the Dana&iuml; with all their fleet<br />
Came thither, then returning, he outshone<span class="lnm">665</span><br />
The noblest Trojans, and at Priam's side<br />
Dwelling, was honor'd by him as a son.<br />
Him Hector reprimanding, stern began.</p>
<p>  Are we thus slack? Can Melanippus view<br />
Unmoved a kinsman slain? Seest not the Greeks<span class="lnm">670</span><br />
How busy there with Dolops and his arms?<br />
Come on. It is no time for distant war,<br />
But either our Achaian foes must bleed,<br />
Or Ilium taken, from her topmost height<br />
Must stoop, and all her citizens be slain.<span class="lnm">675</span></p>
<p>  So saying he went, whose steps the godlike Chief<br />
Attended; and the Telamonian, next,<br />
Huge Ajax, animated thus the Greeks.</p>
<p>  Oh friends, be men! Deep treasure in your hearts<br />
An honest shame, and, fighting bravely, fear<span class="lnm">680</span><br />
Each to incur the censure of the rest.<br />
Of men so minded more survive than die,<br />
While dastards forfeit life and glory both.</p>
<p>  So moved he them, themselves already bent<br />
To chase the Trojans; yet his word they bore<span class="lnm">685</span><br />
Faithful in mind, and with a wall of brass<br />
Fenced firm the fleet, while Jove impell'd the foe.<br />
Then Menelaus, brave in fight, approach'd<br />
Antilochus, and thus his courage roused.</p>
<p>  Antilochus! in all the host is none<span class="lnm">690</span><br />
Younger, or swifter, or of stronger limb<br />
Than thou. Make trial, therefore, of thy might,<br />
Spring forth and prove it on some Chief of Troy.</p>
<p>  He ended and retired, but him his praise<br />
Effectual animated; from the van<span class="lnm">695</span><br />
Starting, he cast a wistful eye around<br />
And hurl'd his glittering spear; back fell the ranks<br />
Of Troy appall'd; nor vain his weapon flew,<br />
But Melanippus pierced heroic son<br />
Of Hicetaon, coming forth to fight,<span class="lnm">700</span><br />
Full in the bosom, and with dreadful sound<br />
<span class="pgnm">381</span><a name="page_381" id="page_381"></a>
Of all his batter'd armor down he fell.<br />
Swift flew Antilochus as flies the hound<br />
Some fawn to seize, which issuing from her lair<br />
The hunter with his lance hath stricken dead,<span class="lnm">705</span><br />
So thee, O Melanippus! to despoil<br />
Of thy bright arms valiant Antilochus<br />
Sprang forth, but not unnoticed by the eye<br />
Of noble Hector, who through all the war<br />
Ran to encounter him; his dread approach<span class="lnm">710</span><br />
Antilochus, although expert in arms,<br />
Stood not, but as some prowler of the wilds,<br />
Conscious of injury that he hath done,<br />
Slaying the watchful herdsman or his dog,<br />
Escapes, ere yet the peasantry arise,<span class="lnm">715</span><br />
So fled the son of Nestor, after whom<br />
The Trojans clamoring and Hector pour'd<br />
Darts numberless; but at the front arrived<br />
Of his own phalanx, there he turn'd and stood.<br />
Then, eager as voracious lions, rush'd<span class="lnm">720</span><br />
The Trojans on the fleet of Greece, the mind<br />
Of Jove accomplishing who them impell'd<br />
Continual, calling all their courage forth,<br />
While, every Grecian heart he tamed, and took<br />
Their glory from them, strengthening Ilium's host.<span class="lnm">725</span><br />
For Jove's unalter'd purpose was to give<br />
Success to Priameian Hector's arms,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_15-14">[14]</a><br />
That he might cast into the fleet of Greece<br />
Devouring flames, and that no part might fail<br />
Of Thetis' ruthless prayer; that sight alone<span class="lnm">730</span><br />
He watch'd to see, one galley in a blaze,<br />
Ordaining foul repulse, thenceforth, and flight<br />
To Ilium's host, but glory to the Greeks.<br />
Such was the cause for which, at first, he moved<br />
To that assault Hector, himself prepared<span class="lnm">735</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">382</span><a name="page_382" id="page_382"></a>
And ardent for the task; nor less he raged<br />
Than Mars while fighting, or than flames that seize<br />
Some forest on the mountain-tops; the foam<br />
Hung at his lips, beneath his awful front<br />
His keen eyes glisten'd, and his helmet mark'd<span class="lnm">740</span><br />
The agitation wild with which he fought.<br />
For Jove omnipotent, himself, from heaven<br />
Assisted Hector, and, although alone<br />
With multitudes he strove, gave him to reach<br />
The heights of glory, for that now his life<span class="lnm">745</span><br />
Waned fast, and, urged by Pallas on,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_15-15">[15]</a> his hour<br />
To die by Peleus' mighty son approach'd.<br />
He then, wherever richest arms he saw<br />
And thickest throng, the warrior-ranks essay'd<br />
To break, but broke them not, though fierce resolved,<span class="lnm">750</span><br />
In even square compact so firm they stood.<br />
As some vast rock beside the hoary Deep<br />
The stress endures of many a hollow wind,<br />
And the huge billows tumbling at his base,<br />
So stood the Dana&iuml;, nor fled nor fear'd.<span class="lnm">755</span><br />
But he, all-fiery bright in arms, the host<br />
Assail'd on every side, and on the van<br />
Fell, as a wave by wintry blasts upheaved<br />
Falls ponderous on the ship; white clings the foam<br />
Around her, in her sail shrill howls the storm,<span class="lnm">760</span><br />
And every seaman trembles at the view<br />
Of thousand deaths from which he scarce escapes,<br />
Such anguish rent the bosom of the Greeks.<br />
But he, as leaps a famish'd lion fell<br />
On beeves that graze some marshy meadow's breadth,<span class="lnm">765</span><br />
A countless herd, tended by one unskill'd<br />
To cope with savage beasts in their defence,<br />
Beside the foremost kine or with the last<br />
He paces heedless, but the lion, borne<br />
<span class="pgnm">383</span><a name="page_383" id="page_383"></a>
Impetuous on the midmost, one devours<span class="lnm">770</span><br />
And scatters all the rest,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_15-16">[16]</a> so fled the Greeks,<br />
Terrified from above, before the arm<br />
Of Hector, and before the frown of Jove.<br />
All fled, but of them all alone he slew<br />
The Mycen&aelig;an Periphetes, son<span class="lnm">775</span><br />
Of Copreus custom'd messenger of King<br />
Eurystheus to the might of Hercules.<br />
From such a sire inglorious had arisen<br />
A son far worthier, with all virtue graced,<br />
Swift-footed, valiant, and by none excell'd<span class="lnm">780</span><br />
In wisdom of the Mycen&aelig;an name;<br />
Yet all but served to ennoble Hector more.<br />
For Periphetes, with a backward step<br />
Retiring, on his buckler's border trod,<br />
Which swept his heels; so check'd, he fell supine,<span class="lnm">785</span><br />
And dreadful rang the helmet on his brows.<br />
Him Hector quick noticing, to his side<br />
Hasted, and, planting in his breast a spear,<br />
Slew him before the phalanx of his friends.<br />
But they, although their fellow-warrior's fate<span class="lnm">790</span><br />
They mourn'd, no succor interposed, or could,<br />
Themselves by noble Hector sore appall'd.</p>
<p>  And now behind the ships (all that updrawn<br />
Above the shore, stood foremost of the fleet)<br />
The Greeks retired; in rush'd a flood of foes;<span class="lnm">795</span><br />
Then, through necessity, the ships in front<br />
Abandoning, amid the tents they stood<br />
Compact, not disarray'd, for shame and fear<br />
Fast held them, and vociferating each<br />
Aloud, call'd ceaseless on the rest to stand.<span class="lnm">800</span><br />
But earnest more than all, guardian of all,<br />
Gerenian Nestor in their parents' name<br />
Implored them, falling at the knees of each.</p>
<p>  Oh friends! be men. Now dearly prize your place<br />
<span class="pgnm">384</span><a name="page_384" id="page_384"></a>
Each in the estimation of the rest.<span class="lnm">805</span><br />
Now call to memory your children, wives,<br />
Possessions, parents; ye whose parents live,<br />
And ye whose parents are not, all alike!<br />
By them as if here present, I entreat<br />
That ye stand fast&mdash;oh be not turn'd to flight!<span class="lnm">810</span></p>
<p>  So saying he roused the courage of the Greeks;<br />
Then, Pallas chased the cloud fall'n from above<br />
On every eye; great light the plain illumed<br />
On all sides, both toward the fleet, and where<br />
The undiscriminating battle raged.<span class="lnm">815</span><br />
Then might be seen Hector and Hector's host<br />
Distinct, as well the rearmost who the fight<br />
Shared not, as those who waged it at the ships.</p>
<p>  To stand aloof where other Grecians stood<br />
No longer now would satisfy the mind<span class="lnm">820</span><br />
Of Ajax, but from deck to deck with strides<br />
Enormous marching, to and fro he swung<br />
With iron studs emboss'd a battle-pole<br />
Unwieldy, twenty and two cubits long.<br />
As one expert to spring from horse to horse,<span class="lnm">825</span><br />
From many steeds selecting four, toward<br />
Some noble city drives them from the plain<br />
Along the populous road; him many a youth<br />
And many a maiden eyes, while still secure<br />
From steed to steed he vaults; they rapid fly;<span class="lnm">830</span><br />
So Ajax o'er the decks of numerous ships<br />
Stalk'd striding large, and sent his voice to heaven.<br />
Thus, ever clamoring, he bade the Greeks<br />
Stand both for camp and fleet. Nor could himself<br />
Hector, contented, now, the battle wage<span class="lnm">835</span><br />
Lost in the multitude of Trojans more,<br />
But as the tawny eagle on full wing<br />
Assails the feather'd nations, geese or cranes<br />
Or swans lithe-neck'd grazing the river's verge,<br />
So Hector at a galley sable-prow'd<span class="lnm">840</span><br />
Darted; for, from behind, Jove urged him on<br />
With mighty hand, and his host after him.<br />
<span class="pgnm">385</span><a name="page_385" id="page_385"></a>
And now again the battle at the ships<br />
Grew furious; thou hadst deem'd them of a kind<br />
By toil untameable, so fierce they strove,<span class="lnm">845</span><br />
And, striving, thus they fought. The Grecians judged<br />
Hope vain, and the whole host's destruction sure;<br />
But nought expected every Trojan less<br />
Than to consume the fleet with fire, and leave<br />
Achaia's heroes lifeless on the field.<span class="lnm">850</span><br />
With such persuasions occupied, they fought.</p>
<p>  Then Hector seized the stern of a brave bark<br />
Well-built, sharp-keel'd, and of the swiftest sail,<br />
Which had to Troy Protesil&auml;us brought,<br />
But bore him never thence. For that same ship<span class="lnm">855</span><br />
Contending, Greeks and Trojans hand to hand<br />
Dealt slaughter mutual. Javelins now no more<br />
Might serve them, or the arrow-starting bow,<br />
But close conflicting and of one mind all<br />
With bill and battle-axe, with ponderous swords,<span class="lnm">860</span><br />
And with long lances double-edged they fought.<br />
Many a black-hilted falchion huge of haft<br />
Fell to the ground, some from the grasp, and some<br />
From shoulders of embattled warriors hewn,<br />
And pools of blood soak'd all the sable glebe.<span class="lnm">865</span><br />
Hector that ship once grappled by the stern<br />
Left not, but griping fast her upper edge<br />
With both hands, to his Trojans call'd aloud.</p>
<p>  Fire! Bring me fire! Stand fast and shout to heaven!<br />
Jove gives us now a day worth all the past;<span class="lnm">870</span><br />
The ships are ours which, in the Gods' despite<br />
Steer'd hither, such calamities to us<br />
Have caused, for which our seniors most I blame<br />
Who me withheld from battle at the fleet<br />
And check'd the people; but if then the hand<span class="lnm">875</span><br />
Of Thunderer Jove our better judgment marr'd,<br />
Himself now urges and commands us on.</p>
<p>  He ceased; they still more violent assail'd<br />
The Grecians. Even Ajax could endure,<br />
Whelm'd under weapons numberless, that storm<span class="lnm">880</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">386</span><a name="page_386" id="page_386"></a>
No longer, but expecting death retired<br />
Down from the decks to an inferior stand,<br />
Where still he watch'd, and if a Trojan bore<br />
Fire thither, he repulsed him with his spear,<br />
Roaring continual to the host of Greece.<span class="lnm">885</span></p>
<p>  Friends! Grecian heroes! ministers of Mars!<br />
Be men, my friends! now summon all your might!<br />
Think we that we have thousands at our backs<br />
To succor us, or yet some stronger wall<br />
To guard our warriors from the battle's force?<span class="lnm">890</span><br />
Not so. No tower'd city is at hand,<br />
None that presents us with a safe retreat<br />
While others occupy our station here,<br />
But from the shores of Argos far remote<br />
Our camp is, where the Trojans arm'd complete<span class="lnm">895</span><br />
Swarm on the plain, and Ocean shuts us in.<br />
Our hands must therefore save us, not our heels</p>
<p>  He said, and furious with his spear again<br />
Press'd them, and whatsoever Trojan came,<br />
Obsequious to the will of Hector, arm'd<span class="lnm">900</span><br />
With fire to burn the fleet, on his spear's point<br />
Ajax receiving pierced him, till at length<br />
Twelve in close fight fell by his single arm.</p>

<h3 class="chap">ARGUMENT OF THE SIXTEENTH BOOK.</h3>

<p class="outd">Achilles, at the suit of Patroclus, grants him his own armor, and permission
to lead the Myrmidons to battle. They, sallying, repulse the Trojans.
Patroclus slays Sarpedon, and Hector, when Apollo had first stripped off
his armor and Euphorbus wounded him, slays Patroclus.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="noind">Such contest for that gallant bark they waged.<br />
Meantime Patroclus, standing at the side<br />
Of the illustrious Chief Achilles, wept<br />
Fast as a crystal fountain from the height<br />
Of some rude rock pours down its rapid<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_16-1">[1]</a> stream.<span class="lnm">5</span><br />
Divine Achilles with compassion moved<br />
Mark'd him, and in wing'd accents thus began.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_16-2">[2]</a></p>
<p>  Who weeps Patroclus like an infant girl<br />
Who, running at her mother's side, entreats<br />
To be uplifted in her arms? She grasps<span class="lnm">10</span><br />
Her mantle, checks her haste, and looking up<br />
With tearful eyes, pleads earnest to be borne;<br />
So fall, Patroclus! thy unceasing tears.<br />
Bring'st thou to me or to my people aught<br />
Afflictive? Hast thou mournful tidings learn'd<span class="lnm">15</span><br />
Prom Phthia, trusted to thy ear alone?<br />
Men&oelig;tius, son of Actor, as they say,<br />
<span class="pgnm">390</span><a name="page_390" id="page_390"></a>
Still lives; still lives his Myrmidons among<br />
Peleus &AElig;acides; whom, were they dead,<br />
With cause sufficient we should both deplore.<span class="lnm">20</span><br />
Or weep'st thou the Achaians at the ships<br />
Perishing, for their outrage done to me?<br />
Speak. Name thy trouble. I would learn the cause</p>
<p>  To whom, deep-sorrowing, thou didst reply,<br />
Patroclus! Oh Achilles, Peleus' son!<span class="lnm">25</span><br />
Noblest of all our host! bear with my grief,<br />
Since such distress hath on the Grecians fallen.<br />
The bravest of their ships disabled lie,<br />
Some wounded from afar, some hand to hand.<br />
Diomede, warlike son of Tydeus, bleeds,<span class="lnm">30</span><br />
Gall'd by a shaft; Ulysses, glorious Chief,<br />
And Agamemnon suffer by the spear,<br />
And brave Eurypylus an arrow-point<br />
Bears in his thigh. These all, are now the care<br />
Of healing hands. Oh thou art pity-proof,<span class="lnm">35</span><br />
Achilles! be my bosom ever free<br />
From anger such as harbor finds in thine,<br />
Scorning all limits! whom, of men unborn,<br />
Hereafter wilt thou save, from whom avert<br />
Disgrace, if not from the Achaians now?<span class="lnm">40</span><br />
Ah ruthless! neither Peleus thee begat,<br />
Nor Thetis bore, but rugged rocks sublime,<br />
And roaring billows blue gave birth to thee,<br />
Who bear'st a mind that knows not to relent,<br />
But, if some prophecy alarm thy fears,<span class="lnm">45</span><br />
If from thy Goddess-mother thou have aught<br />
Received, and with authority of Jove,<br />
Me send at least, me quickly, and with me<br />
The Myrmidons. A dawn of cheerful hope<br />
Shall thence, it may be, on the Greeks arise.<span class="lnm">50</span><br />
Grant me thine armor also, that the foe<br />
Thyself supposing present, may abstain<br />
From battle, and the weary Greeks enjoy<br />
Short respite; it is all that war allows.<br />
We, fresh and vigorous, by our shouts alone<span class="lnm">55</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">391</span><a name="page_391" id="page_391"></a>
May easily repulse an army spent<br />
With labor from the camp, and from the fleet,</p>
<p>  Such suit he made, alas! all unforewarn'd<br />
That his own death should be the bitter fruit,<br />
And thus Achilles, sorrowful, replied.<span class="lnm">60</span></p>
<p>  Patroclus, noble friend! what hast thou spoken?<br />
Me neither prophesy that I have heard<br />
Holds in suspense, nor aught that I have learn'd<br />
From Thetis with authority of Jove!<br />
Hence springs, and hence alone, my grief of heart;<span class="lnm">65</span><br />
If one, in nought superior to myself<br />
Save in his office only, should by force<br />
Amerce me of my well-earn'd recompense&mdash;<br />
How then? There lies the grief that stings my soul.<br />
The virgin chosen for me by the sons<span class="lnm">70</span><br />
Of Greece, my just reward, by my own spear<br />
Obtain'd when I E&euml;tion's city took,<br />
Her, Agamemnon, leader of the host<br />
From my possession wrung, as I had been<br />
Some alien wretch, unhonor'd and unknown.<span class="lnm">75</span><br />
But let it pass; anger is not a flame<br />
To feed for ever; I affirm'd, indeed,<br />
Mine inextinguishable till the shout<br />
Of battle should invade my proper barks;<br />
But thou put on my glorious arms, lead forth<span class="lnm">80</span><br />
My valiant Myrmidons, since such a cloud,<br />
So dark, of dire hostility surrounds<br />
The fleet, and the Achaians, by the waves<br />
Hemm'd in, are prison'd now in narrow space.<br />
Because the Trojans meet not in the field<span class="lnm">85</span><br />
My dazzling helmet, therefore bolder grown<br />
All Ilium comes abroad; but had I found<br />
Kindness at royal Agamemnon's hands,<br />
Soon had they fled, and with their bodies chok'd<br />
The streams, from whom ourselves now suffer siege<span class="lnm">90</span><br />
For in the hands of Diomede his spear<br />
No longer rages rescuing from death<br />
The afflicted Dana&iuml;, nor hear I more<br />
<span class="pgnm">392</span><a name="page_392" id="page_392"></a>
The voice of Agamemnon issuing harsh<br />
From his detested throat, but all around<span class="lnm">95</span><br />
The burst<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_16-3">[3]</a> of homicidal Hector's cries,<br />
Calling his Trojans on; they loud insult<br />
The vanquish'd Greeks, and claim the field their own.<br />
Go therefore, my Patroclus; furious fall<br />
On these assailants, even now preserve<span class="lnm">100</span><br />
From fire the only hope of our return.<br />
But hear the sum of all; mark well my word;<br />
So shalt thou glorify me in the eyes<br />
Of all the Dana&iuml;, and they shall yield<br />
Bris&euml;is mine, with many a gift beside.<span class="lnm">105</span><br />
The Trojans from the fleet expell'd, return.<br />
Should Juno's awful spouse give thee to win<br />
Victory, be content; seek not to press<br />
The Trojans without me, for thou shalt add<br />
Still more to the disgrace already mine.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_16-4">[4]</a><span class="lnm">110</span><br />
Much less, by martial ardor urged, conduct<br />
Thy slaughtering legions to the walls of Troy,<br />
Lest some immortal power on her behalf<br />
Descend, for much the Archer of the skies<br />
Loves Ilium. No&mdash;the fleet once saved, lead back<span class="lnm">115</span><br />
Thy band, and leave the battle to themselves.<br />
For oh, by all the powers of heaven I would<br />
That not one Trojan might escape of all,<br />
Nor yet a Grecian, but that we, from death<br />
Ourselves escaping, might survive to spread<span class="lnm">120</span><br />
Troy's sacred bulwarks on the ground, alone.</p>
<p>  Thus they conferr'd. <a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_16-5">[5]</a>But Ajax overwhelm'd<br />
Meantime with darts, no longer could endure,<br />
Quell'd both by Jupiter and by the spears<br />
Of many a noble Trojan; hideous rang<span class="lnm">125</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">393</span><a name="page_393" id="page_393"></a>
His batter'd helmet bright, stroke after stroke<br />
Sustaining on all sides, and his left arm<br />
That had so long shifted from side to side<br />
His restless shield, now fail'd; yet could not all<br />
Displace him with united force, or move.<span class="lnm">130</span><br />
Quick pantings heaved his chest, copious the sweat<br />
Trickled from all his limbs, nor found he time,<br />
However short, to breathe again, so close<br />
Evil on evil heap'd hemm'd him around.</p>
<p>  Olympian Muses! now declare, how first<span class="lnm">135</span><br />
The fire was kindled in Achaia's fleet?</p>
<p>  Hector the ashen lance of Ajax smote<br />
With his broad falchion, at the nether end,<br />
And lopp'd it sheer. The Telamonian Chief<br />
His mutilated beam brandish'd in vain,<span class="lnm">140</span><br />
And the bright point shrill-sounding-fell remote.<br />
Then Ajax in his noble mind perceived,<br />
Shuddering with awe, the interposing power<br />
Of heaven, and that, propitious to the arms<br />
Of Troy, the Thunderer had ordain'd to mar<span class="lnm">145</span><br />
And frustrate all the counsels of the Greeks.<br />
He left his stand; they fired the gallant bark;<br />
Through all her length the conflagration ran<br />
Incontinent, and wrapp'd her stern in flames.<br />
Achilles saw them, smote his thighs, and said,<span class="lnm">150</span></p>
<p>  Patroclus, noble charioteer, arise!<br />
I see the rapid run of hostile fires<br />
Already in the fleet&mdash;lest all be lost,<br />
And our return impossible, arm, arm<br />
This moment; I will call, myself, the band.<span class="lnm">155</span></p>
<p>  Then put Patroclus on his radiant arms.<br />
Around his legs his polish'd greaves he clasp'd,<br />
With argent studs secured; the hauberk rich<br />
Star-spangled to his breast he bound of swift<br />
&AElig;acides; he slung his brazen sword<span class="lnm">160</span><br />
With silver bright emboss'd, and his broad shield<br />
Ponderous; on his noble head his casque<br />
He settled elegant, whose lofty crest<br />
<span class="pgnm">394</span><a name="page_394" id="page_394"></a>
Waved dreadful o'er his brows, and last he seized<br />
Well fitted to his gripe two sturdy spears.<span class="lnm">165</span><br />
Of all Achilles' arms his spear alone<br />
He took not; that huge beam, of bulk and length<br />
Enormous, none, &AElig;acides except,<br />
In all Achaia's host had power to wield.<br />
It was that Pelian ash which from the top<span class="lnm">170</span><br />
Of Pelion hewn that it might prove the death<br />
Of heroes, Chiron had to Peleus given.<br />
He bade Automedon his coursers bind<br />
Speedily to the yoke, for him he loved<br />
Next to Achilles most, as worthiest found<span class="lnm">175</span><br />
Of trust, what time the battle loudest roar'd.<br />
Then led Automedon the fiery steeds<br />
Swift as wing'd tempests to the chariot-yoke,<br />
Xanthus and Balius. Them the harpy bore<br />
Podarge, while in meadows green she fed<span class="lnm">180</span><br />
On Ocean's side, to Zephyrus the wind.<br />
To these he added, at their side, a third,<br />
The noble Pedasus; him Peleus' son,<br />
E&euml;tion's city taken, thence had brought,<br />
Though mortal, yet a match for steeds divine.<span class="lnm">185</span><br />
Meantime from every tent Achilles call'd<br />
And arm'd his Myrmidons. As wolves that gorge<br />
The prey yet panting, terrible in force,<br />
When on the mountains wild they have devour'd<br />
An antler'd stag new-slain, with bloody jaws<span class="lnm">190</span><br />
Troop all at once to some clear fountain, there<br />
To lap with slender tongues the brimming wave;<br />
No fears have they, but at their ease eject<br />
From full maws flatulent the clotted gore;<br />
Such seem'd the Myrmidon heroic Chiefs<span class="lnm">195</span><br />
Assembling fast around the valiant friend<br />
Of swift &AElig;acides. Amid them stood<br />
Warlike Achilles, the well-shielded ranks<br />
Exhorting, and the steeds, to glorious war.</p>
<p>  The galleys by Achilles dear to Jove<span class="lnm">200</span><br />
Commanded, when to Ilium's coast he steer'd,<br />
<span class="pgnm">395</span><a name="page_395" id="page_395"></a>
Were fifty; fifty rowers sat in each,<br />
And five, in whom he trusted, o'er the rest<br />
He captains named, but ruled, himself, supreme.<br />
One band Menestheus swift in battle led,<span class="lnm">205</span><br />
Offspring of Sperchius heaven-descended stream.<br />
Him Polydora, Peleus' daughter, bore<br />
To ever-flowing Sperchius, compress'd,<br />
Although a mortal woman, by a God.<br />
But his reputed father was the son<span class="lnm">210</span><br />
Of Perieres, Borus, who with dower<br />
Enrich'd, and made her openly his bride.<br />
Warlike Eudorus led the second band.<br />
Him Polymela, graceful in the dance,<br />
And daughter beautiful of Phylas, bore,<span class="lnm">215</span><br />
A mother unsuspected of a child.<br />
Her worshiping the golden-shafted Queen<br />
Diana, in full choir, with song and dance,<br />
The valiant Argicide<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_16-6">[6]</a> beheld and loved.<br />
Ascending with her to an upper room,<span class="lnm">220</span><br />
All-bounteous Mercury<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_16-7">[7]</a> clandestine there<br />
Embraced her, who a noble son produced<br />
Eudorus, swift to run, and bold in fight.<br />
No sooner Ilithya, arbitress<br />
Of pangs puerperal, had given him birth,<span class="lnm">225</span><br />
And he beheld the beaming sun, than her<br />
Echechleus, Actor's mighty son, enrich'd<br />
With countless dower, and led her to his home;<br />
While ancient Phylas, cherishing her boy<br />
With fond affection, reared him as his own.<span class="lnm">230</span><br />
The third brave troop warlike Pisander led,<br />
Offspring of Maimalus; he far excell'd<br />
<span class="pgnm">396</span><a name="page_396" id="page_396"></a>
In spear-fight every Myrmidon, the friend<br />
Of Peleus' dauntless son alone except.<br />
The hoary Ph&oelig;nix of equestrian fame<span class="lnm">235</span><br />
The fourth band led to battle, and the fifth<br />
La&euml;rceus' offspring, bold Alcimedon.<br />
Thus, all his bands beneath their proper Chiefs<br />
Marshall'd, Achilles gave them strict command&mdash;</p>
<p>  Myrmidons! all that vengeance now inflict,<span class="lnm">240</span><br />
Which in this fleet ye ceased not to denounce<br />
Against the Trojans while my wrath endured.<br />
Me censuring, ye have proclaim'd me oft<br />
Obdurate. Oh Achilles! ye have said,<br />
Thee not with milk thy mother but with bile<span class="lnm">245</span><br />
Suckled, who hold'st thy people here in camp<br />
Thus long imprison'd. Unrelenting Chief!<br />
Even let us hence in our sea-skimming barks<br />
To Phthia, since thou can'st not be appeased&mdash;<br />
Thus in full council have ye spoken oft.<span class="lnm">250</span><br />
Now, therefore, since a day of glorious toil<br />
At last appears, such as ye have desired,<br />
There lies the field&mdash;go&mdash;give your courage proof.</p>
<p>  So them he roused, and they, their leader's voice<br />
Hearing elate, to closest order drew.<span class="lnm">255</span><br />
As when an architect some palace wall<br />
With shapely stones upbuilds, cementing close<br />
A barrier against all the winds of heaven,<br />
So wedged, the helmets and boss'd bucklers stood;<br />
Shield, helmet, man, press'd helmet, man, and shield,<span class="lnm">260</span><br />
And every bright-arm'd warrior's bushy crest<br />
Its fellow swept, so dense was their array.<br />
In front of all, two Chiefs their station took,<br />
Patroclus and Automedon; one mind<br />
In both prevail'd, to combat in the van<span class="lnm">265</span><br />
Of all the Myrmidons. Achilles, then,<br />
Retiring to his tent, displaced the lid<br />
Of a capacious chest magnificent<br />
By silver-footed Thetis stow'd on board<br />
His bark, and fill'd with tunics, mantles warm,<span class="lnm">270</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">397</span><a name="page_397" id="page_397"></a>
And gorgeous arras; there he also kept<br />
Secure a goblet exquisitely wrought,<br />
Which never lip touched save his own, and whence<br />
He offer'd only to the Sire of all.<br />
That cup producing from the chest, he first<span class="lnm">275</span><br />
With sulphur fumed it, then with water rinsed<br />
Pellucid of the running stream, and, last<br />
(His hands clean laved) he charged it high with wine.<br />
And now, advancing to his middle court,<br />
He pour'd libation, and with eyes to heaven<span class="lnm">280</span><br />
Uplifted pray'd,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_16-8">[8]</a> of Jove not unobserved.</p>
<p>  Pelasgian, Dodon&aelig;an Jove supreme,<br />
Dwelling remote, who on Dodona's heights<br />
Snow-clad reign'st Sovereign, by thy seers around<br />
Compass'd the Selli, prophets vow-constrain'd<span class="lnm">285</span><br />
To unwash'd feet and slumbers on the ground!<br />
Plain I behold my former prayer perform'd,<br />
Myself exalted, and the Greeks abased.<br />
Now also grant me, Jove, this my desire!<br />
Here, in my fleet, I shall myself abide,<span class="lnm">290</span><br />
But lo! with all these Myrmidons I send<br />
My friend to battle. Thunder-rolling Jove,<br />
Send glory with him, make his courage firm!<br />
That even Hector may himself be taught,<br />
If my companion have a valiant heart<span class="lnm">295</span><br />
When he goes forth alone, or only then<br />
The noble frenzy feels that Mars inspires<br />
When I rush also to the glorious field.<br />
But when he shall have driven the battle-shout<br />
Once from the fleet, grant him with all his arms,<span class="lnm">300</span><br />
None lost, himself unhurt, and my whole band<br />
Of dauntless warriors with him, safe return!</p>
<p>  Such prayer Achilles offer'd, and his suit<br />
Jove hearing, part confirm'd, and part refused;<br />
<span class="pgnm">398</span><a name="page_398" id="page_398"></a>
To chase the dreadful battle from the fleet<span class="lnm">305</span><br />
He gave him, but vouchsafed him no return.<br />
Prayer and libation thus perform'd to Jove<br />
The Sire of all, Achilles to his tent<br />
Return'd, replaced the goblet in his chest,<br />
And anxious still that conflict to behold<span class="lnm">310</span><br />
Between the hosts, stood forth before his tent.</p>
<p>  Then rush'd the bands by brave Patroclus led,<br />
Full on the Trojan host. As wasps forsake<br />
Their home by the way-side, provoked by boys<br />
Disturbing inconsiderate their abode,<span class="lnm">315</span><br />
Not without nuisance sore to all who pass,<br />
For if, thenceforth, some traveller unaware<br />
Annoy them, issuing one and all they swarm<br />
Around him, fearless in their broods' defence,<br />
So issued from their fleet the Myrmidons<span class="lnm">320</span><br />
Undaunted; clamor infinite arose,<br />
And thus Patroclus loud his host address'd.</p>
<p>  Oh Myrmidons, attendants in the field<br />
On Peleus' son, now be ye men, my friends!<br />
Call now to mind the fury of your might;<span class="lnm">325</span><br />
That we, close-fighting servants of the Chief<br />
Most excellent in all the camp of Greece,<br />
May glory gain for him, and that the wide-<br />
Commanding Agamemnon, Atreus' son,<br />
May learn his fault, that he dishonor'd foul<span class="lnm">330</span><br />
The prince in whom Achaia glories most.</p>
<p>  So saying he fired their hearts, and on the van<br />
Of Troy at once they fell; loud shouted all<br />
The joyful Grecians, and the navy rang.<br />
Then, soon as Ilium's host the valiant son<span class="lnm">335</span><br />
Saw of Men&oelig;tius and his charioteer<br />
In dazzling armor clad, all courage lost,<br />
Their closest ranks gave way, believing sure<br />
That, wrath renounced, and terms of friendship chosen,<br />
Achilles' self was there; thus thinking, each<span class="lnm">340</span><br />
Look'd every way for refuge from his fate.</p>
<p>  Patroclus first, where thickest throng he saw<br />
<span class="pgnm">399</span><a name="page_399" id="page_399"></a>
Gather'd tumultuous around the bark<br />
Of brave Protesila&uuml;s, hurl'd direct<br />
At the whole multitude his glittering spear.<span class="lnm">345</span><br />
He smote Pyr&aelig;chmes; he his horsemen band<br />
P&oelig;onian led from Amydon, and from<br />
Broad-flowing Axius. In his shoulder stood<br />
The spear, and with loud groans supine he fell.<br />
At once fled all his followers, on all sides<span class="lnm">350</span><br />
With consternation fill'd, seeing their Chief<br />
And their best warrior, by Patroclus slain.<br />
Forth from the fleet he drove them, quench'd the flames,<br />
And rescued half the ship. Then scatter'd fled<br />
With infinite uproar the host of Troy,<span class="lnm">355</span><br />
While from between their ships the Dana&iuml;<br />
Pour'd after them, and hideous rout ensued.<br />
As when the king of lightnings, Jove, dispels<br />
From some huge eminence a gloomy cloud,<br />
The groves, the mountain-tops, the headland heights<span class="lnm">360</span><br />
Shine all, illumined from the boundless heaven,<br />
So when the Dana&iuml; those hostile fires<br />
Had from their fleet expell'd, awhile they breathed,<br />
Yet found short respite, for the battle yet<br />
Ceased not, nor fled the Trojans in all parts<span class="lnm">365</span><br />
Alike, but still resisted, from the ships<br />
Retiring through necessity alone.<br />
Then, in that scatter'd warfare, every Chief<br />
Slew one. While Are&iuml;lochus his back<br />
Turn'd on Patroclus, sudden with a lance<span class="lnm">370</span><br />
His thigh he pierced, and urged the weapon through,<br />
Shivering the bone; he headlong smote the ground.<br />
The hero Menelaus, where he saw<br />
The breast of Thoas by his slanting shield<br />
Unguarded, struck and stretch'd him at his feet.<span class="lnm">375</span><br />
Phylides,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_16-9">[9]</a> meeting with preventive spear<br />
The furious onset of Amphiclus, gash'd<br />
His leg below the knee, where brawny most<br />
The muscles swell in man; disparted wide<br />
<span class="pgnm">400</span><a name="page_400" id="page_400"></a>
The tendons shrank, and darkness veil'd his eyes.<span class="lnm">380</span><br />
The two Nestorid&aelig; slew each a Chief.<br />
Of these, Antilochus Atymnius pierced<br />
Right through his flank, and at his feet he fell.<br />
With fierce resentment fired Maris beheld<br />
His brother's fall, and guarding, spear in hand,<span class="lnm">385</span><br />
The slain, impetuous on the conqueror flew;<br />
But godlike Thrasymedes<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_16-10">[10]</a> wounded first<br />
Maris, ere he Antilochus; he pierced<br />
His upper arm, and with the lance's point<br />
Rent off and stript the muscles to the bone.<span class="lnm">390</span><br />
Sounding he fell, and darkness veil'd his eyes.<br />
They thus, two brothers by two brothers slain,<br />
Went down to Erebus, associates both<br />
Of brave Sarpedon, and spear-practised sons<br />
Of Amisodarus; of him who fed<span class="lnm">395</span><br />
Chim&aelig;ra,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_16-11">[11]</a> monster, by whom many died.<br />
Ajax the swift on Cleobulus sprang,<br />
Whom while he toil'd entangled in the crowd,<br />
He seized alive, but smote him where he stood<br />
With his huge-hafted sword full on the neck;<span class="lnm">400</span><br />
The blood warm'd all his blade, and ruthless fate<br />
Benighted dark the dying warrior's eyes.<br />
Peneleus into close contention rush'd<br />
And Lycon. Each had hurl'd his glittering spear,<br />
But each in vain, and now with swords they met.<span class="lnm">405</span><br />
He smote Peneleus on the crested casque,<br />
But snapp'd his falchion; him Peneleus smote<br />
Beneath his ear; the whole blade entering sank<br />
Into his neck, and Lycon with his head<br />
Depending by the skin alone, expired.<span class="lnm">410</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">401</span><a name="page_401" id="page_401"></a>
Meriones o'ertaking Acamas<br />
Ere yet he could ascend his chariot, thrust<br />
A lance into his shoulder; down he fell<br />
In dreary death's eternal darkness whelm'd.<br />
Idomeneus his ruthless spear enforced<span class="lnm">415</span><br />
Into the mouth of Erymas. The point<br />
Stay'd not, but gliding close beneath the brain,<br />
Transpierced his spine,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_16-12">[12]</a> and started forth beyond.<br />
It wrench'd his teeth, and fill'd his eyes with blood;<br />
Blood also blowing through his open mouth<span class="lnm">420</span><br />
And nostrils, to the realms of death he pass'd.<br />
Thus slew these Grecian leaders, each, a foe.</p>
<p>  Sudden as hungry wolves the kids purloin<br />
Or lambs, which haply some unheeding swain<br />
Hath left to roam at large the mountains wild;<span class="lnm">425</span><br />
They, seeing, snatch them from beside the dams,<br />
And rend incontinent the feeble prey,<br />
So swift the Dana&iuml; the host assail'd<br />
Of Ilium; they, into tumultuous flight<br />
Together driven, all hope, all courage lost.<span class="lnm">430</span></p>
<p>  Huge Ajax ceaseless sought his spear to cast<br />
At Hector brazen-mail'd, who, not untaught<br />
The warrior's art, with bull-hide buckler stood<br />
Sheltering his ample shoulders, while he mark'd<br />
The hiss of flying shafts and crash of spears.<span class="lnm">435</span><br />
Full sure he saw the shifting course of war<br />
Now turn'd, but scorning flight, bent all his thoughts<br />
To rescue yet the remnant of his friends.</p>
<p>  As when the Thunderer spreads a sable storm<br />
O'er ether, late serene, the cloud that wrapp'd<span class="lnm">440</span><br />
Olympus' head escapes into the skies,<br />
So fled the Trojans from the fleet of Greece<br />
Clamoring in their flight, nor pass'd the trench<br />
In fair array; the coursers fleet indeed<br />
Of Hector, him bore safe with all his arms<span class="lnm">445</span><br />
Right through, but in the foss entangled foul<br />
<span class="pgnm">402</span><a name="page_402" id="page_402"></a>
He left his host, and struggling to escape.<br />
Then many a chariot-whirling steed, the pole<br />
Broken at its extremity, forsook<br />
His driver, while Patroclus with the shout<span class="lnm">450</span><br />
Of battle calling his Achaians on,<br />
Destruction purposed to the powers of Troy.<br />
They, once dispersed, with clamor and with flight<br />
Fill'd all the ways, the dust beneath the clouds<br />
Hung like a tempest, and the steeds firm-hoof'd<span class="lnm">455</span><br />
Whirl'd off at stretch the chariots to the town.<br />
He, wheresoe'er most troubled he perceived<br />
The routed host, loud-threatening thither drove,<br />
While under his own axle many a Chief<br />
Fell prone, and the o'ertumbled chariots rang.<span class="lnm">460</span><br />
Right o'er the hollow foss the coursers leap'd<br />
Immortal, by the Gods to Peleus given,<br />
Impatient for the plain, nor less desire<br />
Felt he who drove to smite the Trojan Chief,<br />
But him his fiery steeds caught swift away.<span class="lnm">465</span></p>
<p>  As when a tempest from autumnal skies<br />
Floats all the fields, what time Jove heaviest pours<br />
Impetuous rain, token of wrath divine<br />
Against perverters of the laws by force,<br />
Who drive forth justice, reckless of the Gods;<span class="lnm">470</span><br />
The rivers and the torrents, where they dwell,<br />
Sweep many a green declivity away,<br />
And plunge at length, groaning, into the Deep<br />
From the hills headlong, leaving where they pass'd<br />
No traces of the pleasant works of man,<span class="lnm">475</span><br />
So, in their flight, loud groan'd the steeds of Troy.<br />
And now, their foremost intercepted all,<br />
Patroclus back again toward the fleet<br />
Drove them precipitate, nor the ascent<br />
Permitted them to Troy for which they strove,<span class="lnm">480</span><br />
But in the midway space between the ships<br />
The river and the lofty Trojan wall<br />
Pursued them ardent, slaughtering whom he reached,<br />
And vengeance took for many a Grecian slain.<br />
<span class="pgnm">403</span><a name="page_403" id="page_403"></a>
First then, with glittering spear the breast he pierced<span class="lnm">485</span><br />
Of Pron&ouml;us, undefended by his shield,<br />
And stretch'd him dead; loud rang his batter'd arms.<br />
The son of Enops, Thestor next he smote.<br />
He on his chariot-seat magnificent<br />
Low-cowering sat, a fear-distracted form,<span class="lnm">490</span><br />
And from his palsied grasp the reins had fallen.<br />
Then came Patroclus nigh, and through his cheek<br />
His teeth transpiercing, drew him by his lance<br />
Sheer o'er the chariot front. As when a man<br />
On some projecting rock seated, with line<span class="lnm">495</span><br />
And splendid hook draws forth a sea-fish huge,<br />
So him wide-gaping from his seat he drew<br />
At his spear-point, then shook him to the ground<br />
Prone on his face, where gasping he expired.<br />
At Eryalus, next, advancing swift<span class="lnm">500</span><br />
He hurl'd a rock; full on the middle front<br />
He smote him, and within the ponderous casque<br />
His whole head open'd into equal halves.<br />
With deadliest night surrounded, prone he fell.<br />
Epaltes, Erymas, Amphoterus,<span class="lnm">505</span><br />
Echius, Tlepolemus Damastor's son,<br />
Evippus, Ipheus, Pyres, Polymelus,<br />
All these he on the champain, corse on corse<br />
Promiscuous flung. Sarpedon, when he saw<br />
Such havoc made of his uncinctured<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_16-13">[13]</a> friends<span class="lnm">510</span><br />
By Men&oelig;tiades, with sharp rebuke<br />
His band of godlike Lycians loud address'd.</p>
<p>  Shame on you, Lycians! whither would ye fly?<br />
Now are ye swift indeed! I will oppose<br />
Myself this conqueror, that I may learn<span class="lnm">515</span><br />
Who thus afflicts the Trojan host, of life<br />
Bereaving numerous of their warriors bold.</p>
<p>  He said, and with his arms leap'd to the ground.<br />
<span class="pgnm">404</span><a name="page_404" id="page_404"></a>
On the other side, Patroclus at that sight<br />
Sprang from his chariot. As two vultures clash<span class="lnm">520</span><br />
Bow-beak'd, crook-talon'd, on some lofty rock<br />
Clamoring both, so they together rush'd<br />
With clamors loud; whom when the son observed<br />
Of wily Saturn, with compassion moved<br />
His sister and his spouse he thus bespake.<span class="lnm">525</span></p>
<p>  Alas, he falls! my most beloved of men<br />
Sarpedon, vanquished by Patroclus, falls!<br />
So will the Fates. Yet, doubtful, much I muse<br />
Whether to place him, snatch'd from furious fight<br />
In Lycia's wealthy realm, or to permit<span class="lnm">530</span><br />
His death by valiant Men&oelig;tiades.</p>
<p>  To whom his awful spouse, displeased, replied.<br />
How speaks the terrible Saturnian Jove!<br />
Wouldst thou again from pangs of death exempt<br />
A mortal man, destined long since to die?<span class="lnm">535</span><br />
Do it. But small thy praise shall be in heaven,<br />
Mark thou my words, and in thy inmost breast<br />
Treasure them. If thou send Sarpedon safe<br />
To his own home, how many Gods <i>their</i> sons<br />
May also send from battle? Weigh it well.<span class="lnm">540</span><br />
For under yon great city fight no few<br />
Sprung from Immortals whom thou shalt provoke.<br />
But if thou love him, and thine heart his lot<br />
Commiserate, leave him by the hands to fall<br />
Of Men&oelig;tiades in conflict dire;<span class="lnm">545</span><br />
But give command to Death and gentle Sleep<br />
That him of life bereft at once they bear<br />
To Lycia's ample realm,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_16-14">[14]</a> where, with due rites<br />
Funereal, his next kindred and his friends<br />
Shall honor him, a pillar and a tomb<span class="lnm">550</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">405</span><a name="page_405" id="page_405"></a>
(The dead man's portion) rearing to his name.</p>
<p>  She said, from whom the Sire of Gods and men<br />
Dissented not, but on the earth distill'd<br />
A sanguine shower in honor of a son<br />
Dear to him, whom Patroclus on the field<span class="lnm">555</span><br />
Of fruitful Troy should slay, far from his home.</p>
<p>  Opposite now, small interval between,<br />
Those heroes stood. Patroclus at his waist<br />
Pierced Thrasymelus the illustrious friend<br />
Of King Sarpedon, and his charioteer.<span class="lnm">560</span><br />
Spear'd through the lower bowels, dead he fell.<br />
Then hurl'd Sarpedon in his turn a lance,<br />
But miss'd Patroclus and the shoulder pierced<br />
Of Pedasus the horse; he groaning heaved<br />
His spirit forth, and fallen on the field<span class="lnm">565</span><br />
In long loud moanings sorrowful expired.<br />
Wide started the immortal pair; the yoke<br />
Creak'd, and entanglement of reins ensued<br />
To both, their fellow slaughter'd at their side.<br />
That mischief soon Automedon redress'd.<span class="lnm">570</span><br />
He rose, and from beside his sturdy thigh<br />
Drawing his falchion, with effectual stroke<br />
Cut loose the side-horse; then the pair reduced<br />
To order, in their traces stood composed,<br />
And the two heroes fierce engaged again.<span class="lnm">575</span></p>
<p>  Again his radiant spear Sarpedon hurl'd,<br />
But miss'd Patroclus; the innocuous point,<br />
O'erflying his left shoulder, pass'd beyond.<br />
Then with bright lance Patroclus in his turn<br />
Assail'd Sarpedon, nor with erring course<span class="lnm">580</span><br />
The weapon sped or vain, but pierced profound<br />
His chest, enclosure of the guarded heart.<br />
As falls an oak, poplar, or lofty pine<br />
With new-edged axes on the mountains hewn<br />
Right through, for structure of some gallant bark,<span class="lnm">585</span><br />
So fell Sarpedon stretch'd his steeds before<br />
And gnash'd his teeth and clutch'd the bloody dust,<br />
And as a lion slays a tawny bull<br />
<span class="pgnm">406</span><a name="page_406" id="page_406"></a>
Leader magnanimous of all the herd;<br />
Beneath the lion's jaws groaning he dies;<span class="lnm">590</span><br />
So, leader of the shielded Lycians groan'd<br />
Indignant, by Patroclus slain, the bold<br />
Sarpedon, and his friend thus, sad, bespake.</p>
<p>  Glaucus, my friend, among these warring Chiefs<br />
Thyself a Chief illustrious! thou hast need<span class="lnm">595</span><br />
Of all thy valor now; now strenuous fight,<br />
And, if thou bear within thee a brave mind,<br />
Now make the war's calamities thy joy.<br />
First, marching through the host of Lycia, rouse<br />
Our Chiefs to combat for Sarpedon slain,<span class="lnm">600</span><br />
Then haste, thyself, to battle for thy friend.<br />
For shame and foul dishonor which no time<br />
Shall e'er obliterate, I must prove to thee,<br />
Should the Achaians of my glorious arms<br />
Despoil me in full prospect<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_16-15">[15]</a> of the fleet.<span class="lnm">605</span><br />
Fight, therefore, thou, and others urge to fight.</p>
<p>  He said, and cover'd by the night of death,<br />
Nor look'd nor breath'd again; for on his chest<br />
Implanting firm his heel, Patroclus drew<br />
The spear enfolded with his vitals forth,<span class="lnm">610</span><br />
Weapon and life at once. Meantime his steeds<br />
<span class="pgnm">407</span><a name="page_407" id="page_407"></a>
Snorted, by Myrmidons detain'd, and, loosed<br />
From their own master's chariot, foam'd to fly.<br />
Terrible was the grief by Glaucus felt,<br />
Hearing that charge, and troubled was his heart<span class="lnm">615</span><br />
That all power fail'd him to protect the dead.<br />
Compressing his own arm he stood, with pain<br />
Extreme tormented which the shaft had caused<br />
Of Teucer, who while Glaucus climb'd the wall,<br />
Had pierced him from it, in the fleet's defence.<span class="lnm">620</span><br />
Then, thus, to Ph&oelig;bus, King shaft-arm'd, he pray'd.</p>
<p>  Hear now, O King! For whether in the land<br />
Of wealthy Lycia dwelling, or in Troy,<br />
Thou hear'st in every place alike the prayer<br />
Of the afflicted heart, and such is mine;<span class="lnm">625</span><br />
Behold my wound; it fills my useless hand<br />
With anguish, neither can my blood be stay'd,<br />
And all my shoulder suffers. I can grasp<br />
A spear, or rush to conflict with the Greeks<br />
No longer now; and we have also lost<span class="lnm">630</span><br />
Our noblest Chief, Sarpedon, son of Jove,<br />
Who guards not his own son. But thou, O King!<br />
Heal me, assuage my anguish, give me strength,<br />
That I may animate the Lycian host<br />
To fight, and may, myself, defend the dead!<span class="lnm">635</span></p>
<p>  Such prayer he offer'd, whom Apollo heard;<br />
He eased at once his pain, the sable blood<br />
Staunch'd, and his soul with vigor new inspired.<br />
Then Glaucus in his heart that prayer perceived<br />
Granted, and joyful for the sudden aid<span class="lnm">640</span><br />
Vouchsafed to him by Ph&oelig;bus, first the lines<br />
Of Lycia ranged, summoning every Chief<br />
To fight for slain Sarpedon; striding next<br />
With eager haste into the ranks of Troy,<br />
Renown'd Agenor and the son he call'd<span class="lnm">645</span><br />
Of Panthus, brave Polydamas, with whom<br />
&AElig;neas also, and approaching last<br />
To Hector brazen-mail'd him thus bespake.</p>
<p>  Now, Hector! now, thou hast indeed resign'd<br />
<span class="pgnm">408</span><a name="page_408" id="page_408"></a>
All care of thy allies, who, for thy sake,<span class="lnm">650</span><br />
Lost both to friends and country, on these plains<br />
Perish, unaided and unmiss'd by thee.<br />
Sarpedon breathless lies, who led to fight<br />
Our shielded bands, and from whose just control<br />
And courage Lycia drew her chief defence.<span class="lnm">655</span><br />
Him brazen Mars hath by the spear subdued<br />
Of Men&oelig;tiades. But stand ye firm!<br />
Let indignation fire you, O my friends!<br />
Lest, stripping him of his resplendent arms,<br />
The Myrmidons with foul dishonor shame<span class="lnm">660</span><br />
His body, through resentment of the deaths<br />
Of numerous Grecians slain by spears of ours.</p>
<p>  He ceased; then sorrow every Trojan heart<br />
Seized insupportable and that disdain'd<br />
All bounds, for that, although a stranger born,<span class="lnm">665</span><br />
Sarpedon ever had a bulwark proved<br />
To Troy, the leader of a numerous host,<br />
And of that host by none in fight excell'd.<br />
Right on toward the Dana&iuml; they moved<br />
Ardent for battle all, and at their head<span class="lnm">670</span><br />
Enraged for slain Sarpedon, Hector came.<br />
Meantime, stout-hearted<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_16-16">[16]</a> Chief, Patroclus roused<br />
The Grecians, and exhorting first (themselves<br />
Already prompt) the Ajaces, thus began.</p>
<p>  Heroic pair! now make it all your joy<span class="lnm">675</span><br />
To chase the Trojan host, and such to prove<br />
As erst, or even bolder, if ye may.<br />
The Chief lies breathless who ascended first<br />
Our wall, Sarpedon. Let us bear him hence,<br />
Strip and dishonor him, and in the blood<span class="lnm">680</span><br />
Of his protectors drench the ruthless spear.</p>
<p>  So Men&oelig;tiades his warriors urged,<br />
Themselves courageous. Then the Lycian host<br />
And Trojan here, and there the Myrmidons<br />
With all the host of Greece, closing the ranks<span class="lnm">685</span><br />
Rush'd into furious contest for the dead,<br />
<span class="pgnm">409</span><a name="page_409" id="page_409"></a>
Shouting tremendous; clang'd their brazen arms,<br />
And Jove with Night's pernicious shades<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_16-17">[17]</a> o'erhung<br />
The bloody field, so to enhance the more<br />
Their toilsome strife for his own son. First then<span class="lnm">690</span><br />
The Trojans from their place and order shock'd<br />
The bright-eyed Grecians, slaying not the least<br />
Nor worst among the Myrmidons, the brave<br />
Epigeus from renown'd Agacles sprung.<br />
He, erst, in populous Budeum ruled,<span class="lnm">695</span><br />
But for a valiant kinsman of his own<br />
Whom there he slew, had thence to Peleus fled<br />
And to his silver-footed spouse divine,<br />
Who with Achilles, phalanx-breaker Chief,<br />
Sent him to fight beneath the walls of Troy.<span class="lnm">700</span><br />
Him seizing fast the body, with a stone<br />
Illustrious Hector smote full on the front,<br />
And his whole skull within the ponderous casque<br />
Split sheer; he prostrate on the body fell<br />
In shades of soul-divorcing death involved.<span class="lnm">705</span><br />
Patroclus, grieving for his slaughter'd friend,<br />
Rush'd through the foremost warriors. As the hawk<br />
Swift-wing'd before him starlings drives or daws,<br />
So thou, Patroclus, of equestrian fame!<br />
Full on the Lycian ranks and Trojan drov'st,<span class="lnm">710</span><br />
Resentful of thy fellow-warrior's fall.<br />
At Sthenela&uuml;s a huge stone he cast,<br />
Son of Ith&aelig;menes, whom on the neck<br />
He smote and burst the tendons; then the van<br />
Of Ilium's host, with Hector, all retired.<span class="lnm">715</span><br />
Far as the slender javelin cuts the air<br />
Hurl'd with collected force, or in the games,<br />
Or even in battle at a desperate foe,<br />
So far the Greeks repulsed the host of Troy.<br />
Then Glaucus first, Chief of the shielded bands<span class="lnm">720</span><br />
Of Lycia, slew Bathycles, valiant son<br />
Of Calchon; Hellas was his home, and far<br />
<span class="pgnm">410</span><a name="page_410" id="page_410"></a>
He pass'd in riches all the Myrmidons.<br />
Him chasing Glaucus whom he now attain'd,<br />
The Lycian, turning sudden, with his lance<span class="lnm">725</span><br />
Pierced through the breast, and, sounding, down he fell<br />
Grief fill'd Achaia's sons for such a Chief<br />
So slain, but joy the Trojans; thick they throng'd<br />
The conqueror around, nor yet the Greeks<br />
Forgat their force, but resolute advanced.<span class="lnm">730</span><br />
Then, by Meriones a Trojan died<br />
Of noble rank, Laogonus, the son<br />
Undaunted of Onetor great in Troy,<br />
Priest of Id&aelig;an Jove. The ear and jaw<br />
Between, he pierced him with a mortal force;<span class="lnm">735</span><br />
Swift flew the life, and darkness veil'd his eyes.<br />
&AElig;neas, in return, his brazen spear<br />
Hurl'd at Meriones with ardent hope<br />
To pierce him, while, with nimble<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_16-18">[18]</a> steps and short<br />
Behind his buckler made, he paced the field;<span class="lnm">740</span><br />
But, warn'd of its approach, Meriones<br />
Bow'd low his head, shunning it, and the spear<br />
Behind him pierced the soil; there quivering stood<br />
The weapon, vain, though from a vigorous arm,<br />
Till spent by slow degrees its fury slept.<span class="lnm">745</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_16-19">[19]</a><br />
Indignant then &AElig;neas thus exclaim'd.</p>
<p><span class="pgnm">411</span><a name="page_411" id="page_411"></a>
  Meriones! I sent thee such a spear<br />
As reaching thee, should have for ever marr'd<span class="lnm">750</span><br />
Thy step, accomplish'd dancer as thou art.</p>
<p>  To whom Meriones spear-famed replied.<br />
&AElig;neas! thou wilt find the labor hard<br />
How great soe'er thy might, to quell the force<br />
Of all opposers. Thou art also doom'd<span class="lnm">755</span><br />
Thyself to die; and may but spear of mine<br />
Well-aim'd once strike thee full, what strength soe'er<br />
Or magnanimity be thine to boast,<br />
Thy glory in that moment thou resign'st<br />
To me, thy soul to Pluto steed-renown'd.<span class="lnm">760</span></p>
<p>  He said, but him Patroclus sharp reproved.<br />
Why speaks Meriones, although in fight<br />
Approved, thus proudly? Nay, my gallant friend!<br />
The Trojans will not for reproach of ours<br />
Renounce the body. Blood must first be spilt.<span class="lnm">765</span><br />
Tongues in debate, but hands in war decide;<br />
Deeds therefore now, not wordy vaunts, we need.</p>
<p>  So saying he led the way, whom follow'd close<br />
Godlike Meriones. As from the depth<br />
Of some lone wood that clothes the mountain's side<span class="lnm">770</span><br />
The fellers at their toil are heard remote,<br />
So, from the face of Ilium's ample plain<br />
Reverberated, was the din of brass<br />
And of tough targets heard by falchions huge<br />
Hard-smitten, and by spears of double-edge.<span class="lnm">775</span><br />
None then, no, not the quickest to discern,<br />
Had known divine Sarpedon, from his head<br />
To his foot-sole with mingled blood and dust<br />
Polluted, and o'erwhelm'd with weapons. They<br />
Around the body swarm'd. As hovel-flies<span class="lnm">780</span><br />
In spring-time buzz around the brimming pails<br />
With milk bedew'd, so they around the dead.<br />
Nor Jove averted once his glorious eyes<br />
From that dread contest, but with watchful note<br />
Marked all, the future death in battle deep<span class="lnm">785</span><br />
Pondering of Patroclus, whether him<br />
<span class="pgnm">412</span><a name="page_412" id="page_412"></a>
Hector should even now slay on divine<br />
Sarpedon, and despoil him of his arms,<br />
Or he should still that arduous strife prolong.<br />
This counsel gain'd as eligible most<span class="lnm">790</span><br />
At length his preference: that the valiant friend<br />
Of Peleus' son should yet again compel<br />
The Trojan host with Hector brazen-mail'd<br />
To Ilium, slaughtering numerous by the way.<br />
First then, with fears unmanly he possess'd<span class="lnm">795</span><br />
The heart of Hector; mounting to his seat<br />
He turn'd to flight himself, and bade his host<br />
Fly also; for he knew Jove's purpose<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_16-20">[20]</a> changed.<br />
Thenceforth, no longer even Lycia's host<br />
Endured, but all fled scatter'd, seeing pierced<span class="lnm">800</span><br />
Their sovereign through his heart, and heap'd with dead;<br />
For numerous, while Saturnian Jove the fight<br />
Held in suspense, had on his body fallen.<br />
At once the Grecians of his dazzling arms<br />
Despoil'd Sarpedon, which the Myrmidons<span class="lnm">805</span><br />
By order of Men&oelig;tius' valiant son<br />
Bore thence into the fleet. Meantime his will<br />
The Thunderer to Apollo thus express'd.</p>
<p>  Ph&oelig;bus, my son, delay not; from beneath<br />
Yon hill of weapons drawn cleanse from his blood<span class="lnm">810</span><br />
Sarpedon's corse; then, bearing him remote,<br />
Lave him in waters of the running stream,<br />
With oils divine anoint, and in attire<br />
Immortal clothe him. Last, to Death and Sleep,<br />
Swift bearers both, twin-born, deliver him;<span class="lnm">815</span><br />
For hence to Lycia's opulent abodes<br />
They shall transport him quickly, where, with rites<br />
Funereal, his next kindred and his friends<br />
Shall honor him, a pillar and a tomb<br />
(The dead man's portion) rearing to his name.<span class="lnm">820</span></p>
<p>  He ceased; nor was Apollo slow to hear<br />
His father's will, but, from the Id&aelig;an heights<br />
<span class="pgnm">413</span><a name="page_413" id="page_413"></a>
Descending swift into the dreadful field,<br />
Godlike Sarpedon's body from beneath<br />
The hill of weapons drew, which, borne remote,<span class="lnm">825</span><br />
He laved in waters of the running stream,<br />
With oils ambrosial bathed, and clothed in robes<br />
Immortal. Then to Death and gentle Sleep,<br />
Swift-bearers both, twin-born, he gave the charge,<br />
Who placed it soon in Lycia's wealthy realm.<span class="lnm">830</span></p>
<p>  Meantime Patroclus, calling to his steeds,<br />
And to Automedon, the Trojans chased<br />
And Lycians, on his own destruction bent<br />
Infatuate; heedless of his charge received<br />
From Peleus' son, which, well perform'd, had saved<span class="lnm">835</span><br />
The hero from his miserable doom.<br />
But Jove's high purpose evermore prevails<br />
Against the thoughts of man; he turns to flight<br />
The bravest, and the victory takes with ease<br />
E'en from the Chief whom he impels himself<span class="lnm">840</span><br />
To battle, as he now this Chief impell'd.<br />
Who, then, Patroclus! first, who last by thee<br />
Fell slain, what time thyself was call'd to die?<br />
Adrastus first, then Perimus he slew,<br />
Offspring of Megas, then Autono&uuml;s,<span class="lnm">845</span><br />
Echechlus, Melanippus, and Epistor,<br />
Pylartes, Mulius, Elasus. All these<br />
He slew, and from the field chased all beside.<br />
Then, doubtless, had Achaia's sons prevail'd<br />
To take proud-gated Troy, such havoc made<span class="lnm">850</span><br />
He with his spear, but that the son of Jove<br />
Apollo, on a tower's conspicuous height<br />
Station'd, devoted him for Ilium's sake.<br />
Thrice on a buttress of the lofty wall<br />
Patroclus mounted, and him thrice the God<span class="lnm">855</span><br />
With hands immortal his resplendent shield<br />
Smiting, struck down again; but when he rush'd<br />
A fourth time, demon-like, to the assault,<br />
The King of radiant shafts him, stern, rebuked.</p>
<p>  Patroclus, warrior of renown, retire!<span class="lnm">860</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">414</span><a name="page_414" id="page_414"></a>
The fates ordain not that imperial Troy<br />
Stoop to thy spear, nor to the spear itself<br />
Of Peleus' son, though mightier far than thou.</p>
<p>  He said, and Men&oelig;tiades the wrath<br />
Of shaft-arm'd Ph&oelig;bus shunning, far retired.<span class="lnm">865</span><br />
But in the Sc&aelig;an gate Hector his steeds<br />
Detain'd, uncertain whether thence to drive<br />
Amid the warring multitude again,<br />
Or, loud commandment issuing, to collect<br />
His host within the walls. Him musing long<span class="lnm">870</span><br />
Apollo, clad in semblance of a Chief<br />
Youthful and valiant, join'd. Asius he seem'd<br />
Equestrian Hector's uncle, brother born<br />
Of Hecuba the queen, and Dymas' son,<br />
Who on the Sangar's banks in Phrygia dwelt.<span class="lnm">875</span><br />
Apollo, so disguised, him thus bespake.</p>
<p>  Why, Hector, hast thou left the fight? this sloth<br />
Not well befits thee. Oh that I as far<br />
Thee pass'd in force as thou transcendest me,<br />
Then, not unpunish'd long, should'st thou retire;<span class="lnm">880</span><br />
But haste, and with thy coursers solid-hoof'd<br />
Seek out Patroclus, him perchance to slay,<br />
Should Ph&oelig;bus have decreed that glory thine.</p>
<p>  So saying, Apollo join'd the host again.<br />
Then noble Hector bade his charioteer<span class="lnm">885</span><br />
Valiant Cebriones his coursers lash<br />
Back into battle, while the God himself<br />
Entering the multitude confounded sore<br />
The Argives, victory conferring proud<br />
And glory on Hector and the host of Troy.<span class="lnm">890</span><br />
But Hector, leaving all beside unslain,<br />
Furious impell'd his coursers solid-hoof'd<br />
Against Patroclus; on the other side<br />
Patroclus from his chariot to the ground<br />
Leap'd ardent; in his left a spear he bore,<span class="lnm">895</span><br />
And in his right a marble fragment rough,<br />
Large as his grasp. With full collected might<br />
He hurl'd it; neither was the weapon slow<br />
<span class="pgnm">415</span><a name="page_415" id="page_415"></a>
To whom he had mark'd, or sent in vain.<br />
He smote the charioteer of Hector, bold<span class="lnm">900</span><br />
Cebriones, King Priam's spurious son,<br />
Full on the forehead, while he sway'd the reins.<br />
The bone that force withstood not, but the rock<br />
With ragged points beset dash'd both his brows<br />
In pieces, and his eyes fell at his feet.<span class="lnm">905</span><br />
He diver-like, from his exalted stand<br />
Behind the steeds pitch'd headlong, and expired;<br />
O'er whom, Patroclus of equestrian fame!<br />
Thou didst exult with taunting speech severe.</p>
<p>  Ye Gods, with what agility he dives!<span class="lnm">910</span><br />
Ah! it were well if in the fishy deep<br />
This man were occupied; he might no few<br />
With oysters satisfy, although the waves<br />
Were churlish, plunging headlong from his bark<br />
As easily as from his chariot here.<span class="lnm">915</span><br />
So then&mdash;in Troy, it seems, are divers too!</p>
<p>  So saying, on bold Cebriones he sprang<br />
With all a lion's force, who, while the folds<br />
He ravages, is wounded in the breast,<br />
And, victim of his own fierce courage, dies.<span class="lnm">920</span><br />
So didst thou spring, Patroclus! to despoil<br />
Cebriones, and Hector opposite<br />
Leap'd also to the ground. Then contest such<br />
For dead Cebriones those two between<br />
Arose, as in the lofty mountain-tops<span class="lnm">925</span><br />
Two lions wage, contending for a deer<br />
New-slain, both hunger-pinch'd and haughty both.<br />
So for Cebriones, alike in arms<br />
Expert, brave Hector and Patroclus strove<br />
To pierce each other with the ruthless spear.<span class="lnm">930</span><br />
First, Hector seized his head, nor loosed his hold,<br />
Patroclus, next, his feet, while all beside<br />
Of either host in furious battle join'd.</p>
<p>  As when the East wind and the South contend<br />
To shake some deep wood on the mountain's side,<span class="lnm">935</span><br />
Or beech, or ash, or rugged cornel old.<br />
<span class="pgnm">416</span><a name="page_416" id="page_416"></a>
With stormy violence the mingled boughs<br />
Smite and snap short each other, crashing loud;<br />
So, Trojans and Achaians, mingling, slew<br />
Mutual, while neither felt a wish to fly.<span class="lnm">940</span><br />
Around Cebriones stood many a spear,<br />
And many a shaft sent smartly from the nerve<br />
Implanted deep, and many a stone of grasp<br />
Enormous sounded on their batter'd shields<br />
Who fought to gain him. He, in eddies lost<span class="lnm">945</span><br />
Of sable dust, with his huge trunk huge space<br />
O'erspread, nor steeds nor chariots heeded more.</p>
<p>  While yet the sun ascending climb'd the heavens,<br />
Their darts flew equal, and the people fell;<br />
But when he westward journey'd, by a change<span class="lnm">950</span><br />
Surpassing hope the Grecians then prevail'd.<br />
They drew Cebriones the hero forth<br />
From all those weapons, and his armor stripp'd<br />
At leisure, distant from the battle's roar.<br />
Then sprang Patroclus on the Trojan host;<span class="lnm">955</span><br />
Thrice, like another Mars, he sprang with shouts<br />
Tremendous, and nine warriors thrice he slew.<br />
But when the fourth time, demon-like, he rush'd<br />
Against them, then, oh then, too manifest<br />
The consummation of thy days approach'd<span class="lnm">960</span><br />
Patroclus! whom Apollo, terror-clad<br />
Met then in battle. He the coming God<br />
Through all that multitude knew not, such gloom<br />
Impenetrable him involved around.<br />
Behind him close he stood, and with his palms<span class="lnm">965</span><br />
Expanded on the spine and shoulders broad<br />
Smote him; his eyes swam dizzy at the stroke.<br />
Then Ph&oelig;bus from his head his helmet dash'd<br />
To earth; sonorous at the feet it roll'd<br />
Of many a prancing steed, and all the crest<span class="lnm">970</span><br />
Defilement gather'd gross of dust and blood,<br />
Then first; till then, impossible; for how<br />
Should dust the tresses of that helmet shame<br />
With which Achilles fighting fenced his head<br />
<span class="pgnm">417</span><a name="page_417" id="page_417"></a>
Illustrious, and his graceful brows divine?<span class="lnm">975</span><br />
But Jove now made it Hector's; he awhile<br />
Bore it, himself to swift perdition doom'd<br />
His spear brass-mounted, ponderous, huge and long,<br />
Fell shiver'd from his grasp. His shield that swept<br />
His ancle, with its belt dropp'd from his arm,<span class="lnm">980</span><br />
And Ph&oelig;bus loosed the corselet from his breast.<br />
Confusion seized his brain; his noble limbs<br />
Quaked under him, and panic-stunn'd he stood.<br />
Then came a Dardan Chief, who from behind<br />
Enforced a pointed lance into his back<span class="lnm">985</span><br />
Between the shoulders; Panthus' son was he,<br />
Euphorbus, famous for equestrian skill,<br />
For spearmanship, and in the rapid race<br />
Past all of equal age. He twenty men<br />
(Although a learner yet of martial feats,<span class="lnm">990</span><br />
And by his steeds then first to battle borne)<br />
Dismounted. He, Patroclus, mighty Chief!<br />
First threw a lance at thee, which yet life<br />
Quell'd not; then snatching hasty from the wound<br />
His ashen beam, he ran into the crowd,<span class="lnm">995</span><br />
Nor dared confront in fight even the unarm'd<br />
Patroclus. But Patroclus, by the lance,<br />
And by the stroke of an immortal hand<br />
Subdued, fell back toward his ranks again.<br />
Then, soon as Hector the retreat perceived<span class="lnm">1000</span><br />
Of brave Patroclus wounded, issuing forth<br />
From his own phalanx, he approach'd and drove<br />
A spear right through his body at the waist.<br />
Sounding he fell. Loud groan'd Achaia's host.<br />
As when the lion and the sturdy boar<span class="lnm">1005</span><br />
Contend in battle on the mountain-tops<br />
For some scant rivulet, thirst-parch'd alike,<br />
Ere long the lion quells the panting boar;<br />
So Priameian Hector, spear in hand,<br />
Slew Men&oelig;tiades the valiant slayer<span class="lnm">1010</span><br />
Of multitudes, and thus in accents wing'd,<br />
With fierce delight exulted in his fall.</p>
<p><span class="pgnm">418</span><a name="page_418" id="page_418"></a>
  It was thy thought, Patroclus, to have laid<br />
Our city waste, and to have wafted hence<br />
Our wives and daughters to thy native land,<span class="lnm">1015</span><br />
Their day of liberty for ever set.<br />
Fool! for their sakes the feet of Hector's steeds<br />
Fly into battle, and myself excel,<br />
For their sakes, all our bravest of the spear,<br />
That I may turn from them that evil hour<span class="lnm">1020</span><br />
Necessitous. But thou art vulture's food,<br />
Unhappy youth! all valiant as he is,<br />
Achilles hath no succor given to thee,<br />
Who when he sent the forth whither himself<br />
Would not, thus doubtless gave thee oft in charge:<span class="lnm">1025</span><br />
Ah, well beware, Patroclus, glorious Chief!<br />
That thou revisit not these ships again,<br />
Till first on hero-slaughterer Hector's breast<br />
Thou cleave his bloody corselet. So he spake,<br />
And with vain words thee credulous beguiled.<span class="lnm">1030</span></p>
<p>  To whom Patroclus, mighty Chief, with breath<br />
Drawn faintly, and dying, thou didst thus reply.<br />
Now, Hector, boast! now glory! for the son<br />
Of Saturn and Apollo, me with ease<br />
Vanquishing, whom they had themselves disarm'd,<span class="lnm">1035</span><br />
Have made the victory thine; else, twenty such<br />
As thou, had fallen by my victorious spear.<br />
Me Ph&oelig;bus and my ruthless fate combined<br />
To slay; these foremost; but of mortal men<br />
Euphorbus, and thy praise is only third.<span class="lnm">1040</span><br />
I tell thee also, and within thy heart<br />
Repose it deep&mdash;thou shalt not long survive;<br />
But, even now, fate, and a violent death<br />
Attend thee by Achilles' hands ordain'd<br />
To perish, by &AElig;acides the brave.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_16-21">[21]</a><span class="lnm">1045</span></p>
<p>  So saying, the shades of death him wrapp'd around.<br />
Down into Ades from his limbs dismiss'd,<br />
<span class="pgnm">419</span><a name="page_419" id="page_419"></a>
His spirit fled sorrowful, of youth's prime<br />
And vigorous manhood suddenly bereft<br />
Then, him though dead, Hector again bespake.<span class="lnm">1050</span></p>
<p>  Patroclus! these prophetic strains of death<br />
At hand, and fate, why hast thou sung to me?<br />
May not the son of Thetis azure-hair'd,<br />
Achilles, perish first by spear of mine?</p>
<p>  He said; then pressing with his heel the trunk<span class="lnm">1055</span><br />
Supine, and backward thursting it, he drew<br />
His glittering weapon from the wound, nor stay'd,<br />
But lance in hand, the godlike charioteer<br />
Pursued of swift &AElig;acides, on fire<br />
To smite Automedon; but him the steeds<span class="lnm">1060</span><br />
Immortal, rapid, by the Gods conferr'd<br />
(A glorious gift) on Peleus, snatch'd away.</p>

<p class="outd">Sharp contest ensues around the body of Patroclus. Hector puts on the
armor of Achilles. Menelaus, having dispatched Antilochus to Achilles
with news of the death of Patroclus, returns to the battle, and, together
with Meriones, bears Patroclus off the field, while the Ajaces cover their
retreat.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="noind">Nor Menelaus, Atreus' valiant son,<br />
Knew not how Men&oelig;tiades had fallen<br />
By Trojan hands in battle; forth he rush'd<br />
All bright in burnish'd armor through his van,<br />
And as some heifer with maternal fears<span class="lnm">5</span><br />
Now first acquainted, compasses around<br />
Her young one murmuring, with tender moan,<br />
So moved the hero of the amber locks<br />
Around Patroclus, before whom his spear<br />
Advancing and broad shield, he death denounced<span class="lnm">10</span><br />
On all opposers; neither stood the son<br />
Spear-famed of Panthus inattentive long<br />
To slain Patroclus, but approach'd the dead,<br />
And warlike Menelaus thus bespake.</p>
<p>  Prince! Menelaus! Atreus' mighty son!<span class="lnm">15</span><br />
Yield. Leave the body and these gory spoils;<br />
For of the Trojans or allies of Troy<br />
None sooner made Patroclus bleed than I.<br />
Seek not to rob me, therefore, of my praise<br />
Among the Trojans, lest my spear assail<span class="lnm">20</span><br />
Thee also, and thou perish premature.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_17-1">[1]</a></p>
<p>  To whom, indignant, Atreus' son replied.<br />
Self-praise, the Gods do know, is little worth.<br />
<span class="pgnm">424</span><a name="page_424" id="page_424"></a>
But neither lion may in pride compare<br />
Nor panther, nor the savage boar whose heart's<span class="lnm">25</span><br />
High temper flashes in his eyes, with these<br />
The spear accomplish'd youths of Panthus' house.<br />
Yet Hyperenor of equestrian fame<br />
Lived not his lusty manhood to enjoy,<br />
Who scoffingly defied my force in arms,<span class="lnm">30</span><br />
And call'd me most contemptible in fight<br />
Of all the Dana&iuml;. But him, I ween,<br />
His feet bore never hence to cheer at home<br />
His wife and parents with his glad return.<br />
So also shall thy courage fierce be tamed,<span class="lnm">35</span><br />
If thou oppose me. I command thee, go&mdash;<br />
Mix with the multitude; withstand not me,<br />
Lest evil overtake thee! To be taught<br />
By sufferings only, is the part of fools.</p>
<p>  He said, but him sway'd not, who thus replied.<span class="lnm">40</span><br />
Now, even now, Atrides! thou shalt rue<br />
My brother's blood which thou hast shed, and mak'st<br />
His death thy boast. Thou hast his blooming bride<br />
Widow'd, and thou hast fill'd his parents' hearts<br />
With anguish of unutterable wo;<span class="lnm">45</span><br />
But bearing hence thy armor and thy head<br />
To Troy, and casting them at Panthus' feet,<br />
And at the feet of Phrontis, his espoused,<br />
I shall console the miserable pair.<br />
Nor will I leave that service unessay'd<span class="lnm">50</span><br />
Longer, nor will I fail through want of force,<br />
Of courage, or of terrible address.</p>
<p>  He ceased, and smote his shield, nor pierced the disk,<br />
But bent his point against the stubborn brass.<br />
Then Menelaus, prayer preferring first<span class="lnm">55</span><br />
To Jove,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_17-2">[2]</a> assail'd Euphorbus in his turn,<br />
Whom pacing backward in the throat he struck,<br />
<span class="pgnm">425</span><a name="page_425" id="page_425"></a>
And both hands and his full force the spear<br />
Impelled, urged it through his neck behind.<br />
Sounding he fell; loud rang his batter'd arms.<span class="lnm">60</span><br />
His locks, which even the Graces might have own'd,<br />
Blood-sullied, and his ringlets wound about<br />
With twine of gold and silver, swept the dust.<br />
As the luxuriant olive by a swain<br />
Rear'd in some solitude where rills abound,<span class="lnm">65</span><br />
Puts forth her buds, and fann'd by genial airs<br />
On all sides, hangs her boughs with whitest flowers,<br />
But by a sudden whirlwind from its trench<br />
Uptorn, it lies extended on the field;<br />
Such, Panthus' warlike son Euphorbus seem'd,<span class="lnm">70</span><br />
By Menelaus, son of Atreus, slain<br />
Suddenly, and of all his arms despoil'd.<br />
But as the lion on the mountains bred,<br />
Glorious in strength, when he hath seized the best<br />
And fairest of the herd, with savage fangs<span class="lnm">75</span><br />
First breaks her neck, then laps the bloody paunch<br />
Torn wide; meantime, around him, but remote,<br />
Dogs stand and swains clamoring, yet by fear<br />
Repress'd, annoy him not nor dare approach;<br />
So there all wanted courage to oppose<span class="lnm">80</span><br />
The force of Menelaus, glorious Chief.<br />
Then, easily had Menelaus borne<br />
The armor of the son of Panthus thence,<br />
But that Apollo the illustrious prize<br />
Denied him, who in semblance of the Chief<span class="lnm">85</span><br />
Of the Ciconians, Mentes, prompted forth<br />
Against him Hector terrible as Mars,<br />
<span class="pgnm">426</span><a name="page_426" id="page_426"></a>
Whose spirit thus in accents wing'd he roused.</p>
<p>  Hector! the chase is vain; here thou pursuest<br />
The horses of &AElig;acides the brave,<span class="lnm">90</span><br />
Which thou shalt never win, for they are steeds<br />
Of fiery nature, such as ill endure<br />
To draw or carry mortal man, himself<br />
Except, whom an immortal mother bore.<br />
Meantime, bold Menelaus, in defence<span class="lnm">95</span><br />
Of dead Patroclus, hath a Trojan slain<br />
Of highest note, Euphorbus, Panthus' son,<br />
And hath his might in arms for ever quell'd.</p>
<p>  So spake the God and to the fight return'd.<br />
But grief intolerable at that word<span class="lnm">100</span><br />
Seized Hector; darting through the ranks his eye,<br />
He knew at once who stripp'd Euphorbus' arms,<br />
And him knew also lying on the field,<br />
And from his wide wound bleeding copious still.<br />
Then dazzling bright in arms, through all the van<span class="lnm">105</span><br />
He flew, shrill-shouting, fierce as Vulcan's fire<br />
Unquenchable; nor were his shouts unheard<br />
By Atreus' son, who with his noble mind<br />
Conferring sad, thus to himself began.</p>
<p>  Alas! if I forsake these gorgeous spoils,<span class="lnm">110</span><br />
And leave Patroclus for my glory slain,<br />
I fear lest the Achaians at that sight<br />
Incensed, reproach me; and if, urged by shame,<br />
I fight with Hector and his host, alone,<br />
Lest, hemm'd around by multitudes, I fall;<span class="lnm">115</span><br />
For Hector, by his whole embattled force<br />
Attended, comes. But whither tend my thoughts?<br />
No man may combat with another fenced<br />
By power divine and whom the Gods exalt,<br />
But he must draw down wo on his own head.<span class="lnm">120</span><br />
Me, therefore, none of all Achaia's host<br />
Will blame indignant, seeing my retreat<br />
From Hector, whom themselves the Gods assist.<br />
But might the battle-shout of Ajax once<br />
Reach me, with force united we would strive,<span class="lnm">125</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">427</span><a name="page_427" id="page_427"></a>
Even in opposition to a God,<br />
To rescue for Achilles' sake, his friend.<br />
Task arduous! but less arduous than this.</p>
<p>  While he thus meditated, swift advanced<br />
The Trojan ranks, with Hector at their head.<span class="lnm">130</span><br />
He then, retiring slow, and turning oft,<br />
Forsook the body. As by dogs and swains<br />
With clamors loud and spears driven from the stalls<br />
A bearded lion goes, his noble heart<br />
Abhors retreat, and slow he quits the prey;<span class="lnm">135</span><br />
So Menelaus with slow steps forsook<br />
Patroclus, and arrived in front, at length,<br />
Of his own phalanx, stood, with sharpen'd eyes<br />
Seeking vast Ajax, son of Telamon.<br />
Him leftward, soon, of all the field he mark'd<span class="lnm">140</span><br />
Encouraging aloud his band, whose hearts<br />
With terrors irresistible himself<br />
Ph&oelig;bus had fill'd. He ran, and at his side<br />
Standing, incontinent him thus bespake.</p>
<p>  My gallant Ajax, haste&mdash;come quickly&mdash;strive<span class="lnm">145</span><br />
With me to rescue for Achilles' sake<br />
His friend, though bare, for Hector hath his arms.</p>
<p>  He said, and by his words the noble mind<br />
Of Ajax roused; issuing through the van<br />
He went, and Menelaus at his side.<span class="lnm">150</span><br />
Hector the body of Patroclus dragg'd,<br />
Stript of his arms, with falchion keen erelong<br />
Purposing to strike off his head, and cast<br />
His trunk, drawn distant, to the dogs of Troy.<br />
But Ajax, with broad shield tower-like, approach'd.<span class="lnm">155</span><br />
Then Hector, to his bands retreating, sprang<br />
Into his chariot, and to others gave<br />
The splendid arms in charge, who into Troy<br />
Should bear the destined trophy of his praise,<br />
But Ajax with his broad shield guarding stood<span class="lnm">160</span><br />
Slain Men&oelig;tiades, as for his whelps<br />
The lion stands; him through some forest drear<br />
Leading his little ones, the hunters meet;<br />
<span class="pgnm">428</span><a name="page_428" id="page_428"></a>
Fire glimmers in his looks, and down he draws<br />
His whole brow into frowns, covering his eyes;<span class="lnm">165</span><br />
So, guarding slain Patroclus, Ajax lour'd.<br />
On the other side, with tender grief oppress'd<br />
Unspeakable, brave Menelaus stood.<br />
But Glaucus, leader of the Lycian band,<br />
Son of Hippolochus, in bitter terms<span class="lnm">170</span><br />
Indignant, reprimanded Hector thus,</p>
<p>  Ah, Hector, Chieftain of excelling form,<br />
But all unfurnish'd with a warrior's heart!<br />
Unwarranted I deem thy great renown<br />
Who art to flight addicted. Think, henceforth,<span class="lnm">175</span><br />
How ye shall save city and citadel<br />
Thou and thy people born in Troy, alone.<br />
No Lycian shall, at least, in your defence<br />
Fight with the Grecians, for our ceaseless toil<br />
In arms, hath ever been a thankless task.<span class="lnm">180</span><br />
Inglorious Chief! how wilt thou save a worse<br />
From warring crowds, who hast Sarpedon left<br />
Thy guest, thy friend, to be a spoil, a prey<br />
To yonder Argives? While he lived he much<br />
Thee and thy city profited, whom dead<span class="lnm">185</span><br />
Thou fear'st to rescue even from the dogs.<br />
Now, therefore, may but my advice prevail,<br />
Back to your country, Lycians! so, at once,<br />
Shall remediless ruin fall on Troy.<br />
For had the Trojans now a daring heart<span class="lnm">190</span><br />
Intrepid, such as in the breast resides<br />
Of laborers in their country's dear behalf,<br />
We soon should drag Patroclus into Troy;<br />
And were his body, from the battle drawn,<br />
In Priam's royal city once secured,<span class="lnm">195</span><br />
As soon, the Argives would in ransom give<br />
Sarpedon's body with his splendid arms<br />
To be conducted safe into the town.<br />
For when Patroclus fell, the friend was slain<br />
Of such a Chief as is not in the fleet<span class="lnm">200</span><br />
For valor, and his bands are dauntless all.<br />
<span class="pgnm">429</span><a name="page_429" id="page_429"></a>
But thou, at the first glimpse of Ajax' eye<br />
Confounded, hast not dared in arms to face<br />
That warrior bold, superior far to thee.</p>
<p>  To whom brave Hector, frowning stern, replied,<span class="lnm">205</span><br />
Why, Glaucus! should a Chief like thee his tongue<br />
Presume to employ thus haughtily? My friend!<br />
I thee accounted wisest, once, of all<br />
Who dwell in fruitful Lycia, but thy speech<br />
Now utter'd altogether merits blame,<span class="lnm">210</span><br />
In which thou tell'st me that I fear to stand<br />
Against vast Ajax. Know that I from fight<br />
Shrink not, nor yet from sound of prancing steeds;<br />
But Jove's high purpose evermore prevails<br />
Against the thoughts of man; he turns to flight<span class="lnm">215</span><br />
The bravest, and the victory takes with ease<br />
Even from those whom once he favor'd most.<br />
But hither, friend! stand with me; mark my deed;<br />
Prove me, if I be found, as thou hast said,<br />
An idler all the day, or if by force<span class="lnm">220</span><br />
I not compel some Grecian to renounce<br />
Patroclus, even the boldest of them all.</p>
<p>  He ceased, and to his host exclaim'd aloud.<br />
Trojans, and Lycians, and close-fighting sons<br />
Of Dardanus, oh be ye men, my friends!<span class="lnm">225</span><br />
Now summon all your fortitude, while I<br />
Put on the armor of Achilles, won<br />
From the renown'd Patroclus slain by me.</p>
<p>  So saying, illustrious Hector from the clash<br />
Of spears withdrew, and with his swiftest pace<span class="lnm">230</span><br />
Departing, overtook, not far remote,<br />
The bearers of Achilles' arms to Troy.<br />
Apart from all the horrors of the field<br />
Standing, he changed his armor; gave his own<br />
To be by them to sacred Ilium borne,<span class="lnm">235</span><br />
And the immortal arms of Peleus' son<br />
Achilles, by the ever-living Gods<br />
To Pele&uuml;s given, put on. Those arms the Sire,<br />
Now old himself, had on his son conferr'd<br />
<span class="pgnm">430</span><a name="page_430" id="page_430"></a>
But in those arms his son grew never old.<span class="lnm">240</span></p>
<p>  Him, therefore, soon as cloud-assembler Jove<br />
Saw glittering in divine Achilles' arms,<br />
Contemplative he shook his brows, and said,</p>
<p>  Ah hapless Chief! thy death, although at hand,<br />
Nought troubles thee. Thou wear'st his heavenly<span class="lnm">245</span><br />
Who all excels, terror of Ilium's host.<br />
His friend, though bold yet gentle, thou hast slain<br />
And hast the brows and bosom of the dead<br />
Unseemly bared: yet, bright success awhile<br />
I give thee; so compensating thy lot,<span class="lnm">250</span><br />
From whom Andromache shall ne'er receive<br />
Those glorious arms, for thou shalt ne'er return.</p>
<p>  So spake the Thunderer, and his sable brows<br />
Shaking, confirm'd the word. But Hector found<br />
The armor apt; the God of war his soul<span class="lnm">255</span><br />
With fury fill'd, he felt his limbs afresh<br />
Invigorated, and with loudest shouts<br />
Return'd to his illustrious allies.<br />
To them he seem'd, clad in those radiant arms,<br />
Himself Achilles; rank by rank he pass'd<span class="lnm">260</span><br />
Through all the host, exhorting every Chief,<br />
Asterop&aelig;us, Mesthles, Phorcys, Medon,<br />
Thersilochus, Deisenor, augur Ennomus,<br />
Chromius, Hippotho&uuml;s; all these he roused<br />
To battle, and in accents wing'd began.<span class="lnm">265</span></p>
<p>  Hear me, ye myriads, neighbors and allies!<br />
For not through fond desire to fill the plain<br />
With multitudes, have I convened you here<br />
Each from his city, but that well-inclined<br />
To Ilium, ye might help to guard our wives<span class="lnm">270</span><br />
And little ones against the host of Greece.<br />
Therefore it is that forage large and gifts<br />
Providing for you, I exhaust the stores<br />
Of Troy, and drain our people for your sake.<br />
Turn then direct against them, and his life<span class="lnm">275</span><br />
Save each, or lose; it is the course of war.<br />
Him who shall drag, though dead, Patroclus home<br />
<span class="pgnm">431</span><a name="page_431" id="page_431"></a>
Into the host of Troy, and shall repulse<br />
Ajax, I will reward with half the spoils<br />
And half shall be my own; glory and praise<span class="lnm">280</span><br />
Shall also be his meed, equal to mine.</p>
<p>  He ended; they compact with lifted spears<br />
Bore on the Dana&iuml;, conceiving each<br />
Warm expectation in his heart to wrest<br />
From Ajax son of Telamon, the dead.<span class="lnm">285</span><br />
Vain hope! he many a lifeless Trojan heap'd<br />
On slain Patroclus, but at length his speech<br />
To warlike Menelaus thus address'd.</p>
<p>  Ah, Menelaus, valiant friend! I hope<br />
No longer, now, that even we shall 'scape<span class="lnm">290</span><br />
Ourselves from fight; nor fear I so the loss<br />
Of dead Patroclus, who shall soon the dogs<br />
Of Ilium, and the fowls sate with his flesh,<br />
As for my life I tremble and for thine,<br />
That cloud of battle, Hector, such a gloom<span class="lnm">295</span><br />
Sheds all around; death manifest impends.<br />
Haste&mdash;call our best, if even they can hear.</p>
<p>  He spake, nor Menelaus not complied,<br />
But call'd aloud on all the Chiefs of Greece.</p>
<p>  Friends, senators, and leaders of the powers<span class="lnm">300</span><br />
Of Argos! who with Agamemnon drink<br />
And Menelaus at the public feast,<br />
Each bearing rule o'er many, by the will<br />
Of Jove advanced to honor and renown!<br />
The task were difficult to single out<span class="lnm">305</span><br />
Chief after Chief by name amid the blaze<br />
Of such contention; but oh, come yourselves<br />
Indignant forth, nor let the dogs of Troy<br />
Patroclus rend, and gambol with his bones!</p>
<p>  He ceased, whom O&iuml;liades the swift<span class="lnm">310</span><br />
Hearing incontinent, of all the Chiefs<br />
Ran foremost, after whom Idomeneus<br />
Approach'd, and dread as homicidal Mars<br />
Meriones. But never mind of man<br />
Could even in silent recollection name<span class="lnm">315</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">432</span><a name="page_432" id="page_432"></a>
The whole vast multitude who, following these<br />
Renew'd the battle on the part of Greece.<br />
The Trojans first, with Hector at their head,<br />
Wedged in close phalanx, rush'd to the assault</p>
<p>  As when within some rapid river's mouth<span class="lnm">320</span><br />
The billows and stream clash, on either shore<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_17-3">[3]</a><br />
Loud sounds the roar<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_17-3">[3]</a> of waves ejected wide,<br />
Such seem'd the clamors of the Trojan host.<br />
But the Achaians, one in heart, around<br />
Patroclus stood, bulwark'd with shields of brass<span class="lnm">325</span><br />
And over all their glittering helmets Jove<br />
Darkness diffused, for he had loved Patroclus<br />
While yet he lived friend of &AElig;acides,<br />
And now, abhorring that the dogs of Troy<br />
Should eat him, urged the Greeks to his defence,<span class="lnm">330</span><br />
The host of Troy first shook the Grecian host;<br />
The body left, they fled; yet of them all,<br />
The Trojan powers, determined as they were,<br />
Slew none, but dragg'd the body. Neither stood<br />
The Greeks long time aloof, soon as repulsed<span class="lnm">335</span><br />
Again led on by Ajax, who in form<br />
And in exploits all others far excell'd.<br />
Peerless &AElig;acides alone except.<br />
Right through the foremost combatants he rush'd,<br />
In force resembling most some savage boar<span class="lnm">340</span><br />
That in the mountains bursting through the brakes,<br />
The swains disperses and their hounds with ease;<br />
Like him, illustrious Ajax, mighty son<br />
Of Telamon, at his assault dispersed<br />
With ease the close imbattled ranks who fought<span class="lnm">345</span><br />
Around Patroclus' body, strong in hope<br />
To achieve it, and to make the glory theirs.<br />
Hippotho&uuml;s, a youth of high renown,<br />
Son of Pelasgian Lethus, by a noose<br />
Around his ancle cast dragg'd through the fight<span class="lnm">350</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">433</span><a name="page_433" id="page_433"></a>
Patroclus, so to gratify the host<br />
Of Ilium and their Chief; but evil him<br />
Reached suddenly, by none of all his friends<br />
(Though numerous wish'd to save him) turn'd aside.<br />
For swift advancing on him through the crowd<span class="lnm">355</span><br />
The son of Telamon pierced, spear in hand,<br />
His helmet brazen-cheek'd; the crested casque,<br />
So smitten, open'd wide, for huge the hand<br />
And ponderous was the spear that gave the blow<br />
And all around its neck, mingled with blood<span class="lnm">360</span><br />
Gush'd forth the brain. There, lifeless, down he sank,<br />
Let fall the hero's foot, and fell himself<br />
Prone on the dead, never to see again?<br />
Deep-soil'd Larissa, never to require<br />
Their kind solicitudes who gave him birth,<span class="lnm">365</span><br />
In bloom of life by dauntless Ajax slain.<br />
Then Hector hurl'd at Ajax his bright spear,<br />
But he, forewarn'd of its approach, escaped<br />
Narrowly, and it pierced Schedius instead,<br />
Brave son of Iphitus; he, noblest Chief<span class="lnm">370</span><br />
Of the Phocensians, over many reign'd,<br />
Dwelling in Panopeus the far-renown'd.<br />
Entering beneath the clavicle<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_17-4">[4]</a> the point<br />
Right through his shoulder's summit pass'd behind,<br />
And on his loud-resounding arms he fell.<span class="lnm">375</span><br />
But Ajax at his waist wounded the son<br />
Of Ph&oelig;nops, valiant Phorcys, while he stood<br />
Guarding Hippoth&ouml;us; through his hollow mail<br />
Enforced the weapon drank his inmost life,<br />
And in his palm, supine, he clench'd the dust.<span class="lnm">380</span><br />
Then, Hector with the foremost Chiefs of Troy<br />
Fell back; the Argives sent a shout to heaven,<br />
And dragging Phorcys and Hippoth&ouml;us thence<br />
Stripp'd both. In that bright moment Ilium's host<br />
Fear-quell'd before Achaia's warlike sons<span class="lnm">385</span><br />
Had Troy re-enter'd, and the host of Greece<br />
By matchless might and fortitude their own<br />
<span class="pgnm">434</span><a name="page_434" id="page_434"></a>
Had snatch'd a victory from the grasp of fate,<br />
But that, himself, the King of radiant shafts<br />
&AElig;neas roused; Epytis' son he seem'd<span class="lnm">390</span><br />
Periphas, ancient in the service grown<br />
Of old Anchises whom he dearly loved;<br />
His form assumed, Apollo thus began.</p>
<p>  How could ye save, &AElig;neas, were the Gods<br />
Your enemies, the towers of lofty Troy?<span class="lnm">395</span><br />
As I have others seen, warriors who would,<br />
Men fill'd with might and valor, firm themselves<br />
And Chiefs of multitudes disdaining fear.<br />
But Jove to us the victory far more<br />
Than to the Grecians wills; therefore the fault<span class="lnm">400</span><br />
Is yours, who tremble and refuse the fight.</p>
<p>  He ended, whom &AElig;neas marking, knew<br />
At once the glorious Archer of the skies,<br />
And thus to distant Hector call'd aloud.</p>
<p>  Oh, Hector, and ye other Chiefs of Troy<span class="lnm">405</span><br />
And of her brave confederates! Shame it were<br />
Should we re-enter Ilium, driven to flight<br />
By dastard fear before the host of Greece.<br />
A God assured me even now, that Jove,<br />
Supreme in battle, gives his aid to Troy.<span class="lnm">410</span><br />
Rush, therefore, on the Dana&iuml; direct,<br />
Nor let them, safe at least and unannoy'd,<br />
Bear hence Patroclus' body to the fleet.</p>
<p>  He spake, and starting far into the van<br />
Stood foremost forth; they, wheeling, faced the Greeks.<span class="lnm">415</span><br />
Then, spear in hand, &AElig;neas smote the friend<br />
Of Lycomedes, brave Leocritus,<br />
Son of Arisbas. Lycomedes saw<br />
Compassionate his death, and drawing nigh<br />
First stood, then hurling his resplendent lance,<span class="lnm">420</span><br />
Right through the liver Apisaon pierced<br />
Offspring of Hippasus, his chest beneath,<br />
And, lifeless, instant, on the field he fell.<br />
He from P&aelig;onia the deep soil'd to Troy<br />
Came forth, Asterop&aelig;us sole except,<span class="lnm">425</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">435</span><a name="page_435" id="page_435"></a>
Bravest of all P&aelig;onia's band in arms.<br />
Asterop&aelig;us saw, and to the van<br />
Sprang forth for furious combat well prepared,<br />
But room for fight found none, so thick a fence<br />
Of shields and ported spears fronted secure<span class="lnm">430</span><br />
The phalanx guarding Men&oelig;tiades.<br />
For Ajax ranging all the ranks, aloud<br />
Admonish'd them that no man yielding ground<br />
Should leave Patroclus, or advance before<br />
The rest, but all alike fight and stand fast.<span class="lnm">435</span><br />
Such order gave huge Ajax; purple gore<br />
Drench'd all the ground; in slaughter'd heaps they fell<br />
Trojans and Trojan aids of dauntless hearts<br />
And Grecians; for not even they the fight<br />
Waged bloodless, though with far less cost of blood,<span class="lnm">440</span><br />
Each mindful to avert his fellow's fate.</p>
<p>  Thus burn'd the battle; neither hadst thou deem'd<br />
The sun himself in heaven unquench'd, or moon,<br />
Beneath a cope so dense of darkness strove<br />
Unceasing all the most renown'd in arms<span class="lnm">445</span><br />
For Men&oelig;tiades. Meantime the war,<br />
Wherever else, the bright-arm'd Grecians waged<br />
And Trojans under skies serene. The sun<br />
On them his radiance darted; not a cloud,<br />
From mountain or from vale rising, allay'd<span class="lnm">450</span><br />
His fervor; there at distance due they fought<br />
And paused by turns, and shunn'd the cruel dart.<br />
But in the middle field not war alone<br />
They suffer'd, but night also; ruthless raged<br />
The iron storm, and all the mightiest bled.<span class="lnm">455</span><br />
Two glorious Chiefs, the while, Antilochus<br />
And Thrasymedes, had no tidings heard<br />
Of brave Patroclus slain, but deem'd him still<br />
Living, and troubling still the host of Troy;<br />
For watchful<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_17-5">[5]</a> only to prevent the flight<span class="lnm">460</span><br />
Or slaughter of their fellow-warriors, they<br />
<span class="pgnm">436</span><a name="page_436" id="page_436"></a>
Maintain'd a distant station, so enjoin'd<br />
By Nestor when he sent them to the field.<br />
But fiery conflict arduous employ'd<br />
The rest all day continual; knees and legs,<span class="lnm">465</span><br />
Feet, hands, and eyes of those who fought to guard<br />
The valiant friend of swift &AElig;acides<br />
Sweat gather'd foul and dust. As when a man<br />
A huge ox-hide drunken with slippery lard<br />
Gives to be stretch'd, his servants all around<span class="lnm">470</span><br />
Disposed, just intervals between, the task<br />
Ply strenuous, and while many straining hard<br />
Extend it equal on all sides, it sweats<br />
The moisture out, and drinks the unction in,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_17-6">[6]</a><br />
So they, in narrow space struggling, the dead<span class="lnm">475</span><br />
Dragg'd every way, warm hope conceiving, these<br />
To drag him thence to Troy, those, to the ships.<br />
Wild tumult raged around him; neither Mars,<br />
Gatherer of hosts to battle, nor herself<br />
Pallas, however angry, had beheld<span class="lnm">480</span><br />
That conflict with disdain, Jove to such length<br />
Protracted on that day the bloody toil<br />
Of steeds and men for Men&oelig;tiades.<br />
Nor knew divine Achilles or had aught<br />
Heard of Patroclus slain, for from the ships<span class="lnm">485</span><br />
Remote they fought, beneath the walls of Troy.<br />
He, therefore, fear'd not for his death, but hope<br />
Indulged much rather, that, the battle push'd<br />
To Ilium's gates, he should return alive.<br />
For that his friend, unaided by himself<span class="lnm">490</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">437</span><a name="page_437" id="page_437"></a>
Or ever aided, should prevail to lay<br />
Troy waste, he nought supposed; by Thetis warn'd<br />
In secret conference oft, he better knew<br />
Jove's purpose; yet not even she had borne<br />
Those dreadful tidings to his ear, the loss<span class="lnm">495</span><br />
Immeasurable of his dearest friend.</p>
<p>  They all around the dead fought spear in hand<br />
With mutual slaughter ceaseless, and amid<br />
Achaia's host thus spake a Chief mail-arm'd.</p>
<p>  Shame were it, Grecians! should we seek by flight<span class="lnm">500</span><br />
Our galleys now; yawn earth our feet beneath<br />
And here ingulf us rather! Better far<br />
Than to permit the steed-famed host of Troy<br />
To drag Patroclus hence into the town,<br />
And make the glory of this conflict theirs.<span class="lnm">505</span></p>
<p>  Thus also of the dauntless Trojans spake<br />
A certain warrior. Oh, my friends! although<br />
The Fates ordain us, one and all, to die<br />
Around this body, stand! quit not the field.</p>
<p>  So spake the warrior prompting into act<span class="lnm">510</span><br />
The courage of his friends, and such they strove<br />
On both sides; high into the vault of heaven<br />
The iron din pass'd through the desart air.<br />
Meantime the horses of &AElig;acides<br />
From fight withdrawn, soon as they understood<span class="lnm">515</span><br />
Their charioteer fallen in the dust beneath<br />
The arm of homicidal Hector, wept.<br />
Them oft with hasty lash Diores' son<br />
Automedon impatient smote, full oft<br />
He stroked them gently, and as oft he chode;<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_17-7">[7]</a><span class="lnm">520</span><br />
Yet neither to the fleet ranged on the shore<br />
Of spacious Hellespont would they return,<br />
Nor with the Grecians seek the fight, but stood<br />
As a sepulchral pillar stands, unmoved<br />
Between their traces;<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_17-8">[8]</a> to the earth they hung<span class="lnm">525</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">438</span><a name="page_438" id="page_438"></a>
Their heads, with plenteous tears their driver mourn'd,<br />
And mingled their dishevell'd manes with dust.<br />
Jove saw their grief with pity, and his brows<br />
Shaking, within himself thus, pensive, said.</p>
<p>  Ah hapless pair! Wherefore by gift divine<span class="lnm">530</span><br />
Were ye to Peleus given, a mortal king,<br />
Yourselves immortal and from age exempt?<br />
Was it that ye might share in human woes?<br />
For, of all things that breathe or creep the earth,<br />
No creature lives so mere a wretch as man.<span class="lnm">535</span><br />
Yet shall not Priameian Hector ride<br />
Triumphant, drawn by you. Myself forbid.<br />
Suffice it that he boasts vain-gloriously<br />
Those arms his own. Your spirit and your limbs<br />
I will invigorate, that ye may bear<span class="lnm">540</span><br />
Safe hence Automedon into the fleet.<br />
For I ordain the Trojans still to spread<br />
Carnage around victorious, till they reach<br />
The gallant barks, and till the sun at length<br />
Descending, sacred darkness cover all.<span class="lnm">545</span></p>
<p>  He said, and with new might the steeds inspired.<br />
They, shaking from their hair profuse the dust,<br />
Between the van of either army whirl'd<br />
The rapid chariot. Fighting as he pass'd,<br />
Though fill'd with sorrow for his slaughter'd friend,<span class="lnm">550</span><br />
Automedon high-mounted swept the field<br />
Impetuous as a vulture scattering geese;<br />
Now would he vanish, and now, turn'd again,<br />
Chase through a multitude his trembling foe;<br />
But whomsoe'er he follow'd, none he slew,<span class="lnm">555</span><br />
Nor was the task possible to a Chief<br />
Sole in the sacred chariot, both to aim<br />
The spear aright and guide the fiery steeds.<br />
<span class="pgnm">439</span><a name="page_439" id="page_439"></a>
At length Alcimedon, his friend in arms,<br />
Son of Laerceus son of &AElig;mon, him<span class="lnm">560</span><br />
Observing, from behind the chariot hail'd<br />
The flying warrior, whom he thus bespake.</p>
<p>  What power, Automedon! hath ta'en away<br />
Thy better judgment, and thy breast inspired<br />
With this vain purpose to assail alone<span class="lnm">565</span><br />
The Trojan van? Thy partner in the fight<br />
Is slain, and Hector on his shoulders bears,<br />
Elate, the armor of &AElig;acides.</p>
<p>  Then, answer thus Automedon return'd,<br />
Son of Diores. Who of all our host<span class="lnm">570</span><br />
Was ever skill'd, Alcimedon! as thou<br />
To rule the fire of these immortal steeds,<br />
Save only while he lived, peer of the Gods<br />
In that great art, Patroclus, now no more?<br />
Thou, therefore, the resplendent reins receive<span class="lnm">575</span><br />
And scourge, while I, dismounting, wage the fight.</p>
<p>  He ceased; Alcimedon without delay<br />
The battle-chariot mounting, seized at once<br />
The lash and reins, and from his seat down leap'd<br />
Automedon. Them noble Hector mark'd,<span class="lnm">580</span><br />
And to &AElig;neas at his side began.</p>
<p>  Illustrious Chief of Trojans brazen-mail'd<br />
&AElig;neas! I have noticed yonder steeds<br />
Of swift Achilles rushing into fight<br />
Conspicuous, but under sway of hands<span class="lnm">585</span><br />
Unskilful; whence arises a fair hope<br />
That we might seize them, wert thou so inclined;<br />
For never would those two dare to oppose<br />
In battle an assault dreadful as ours.</p>
<p>  He ended, nor the valiant son refused<span class="lnm">590</span><br />
Of old Anchises, but with targets firm<br />
Of season'd hide brass-plated thrown athwart<br />
Their shoulders, both advanced direct, with whom<br />
Of godlike form Aretus also went<br />
And Chromius. Ardent hope they all conceived<span class="lnm">595</span><br />
To slay those Chiefs, and from the field to drive<br />
<span class="pgnm">440</span><a name="page_440" id="page_440"></a>
Achilles' lofty steeds. Vain hope! for them<br />
No bloodless strife awaited with the force<br />
Of brave Automedon; he, prayer to Jove<br />
First offering, felt his angry soul with might<span class="lnm">600</span><br />
Heroic fill'd, and thus his faithful friend<br />
Alcimedon, incontinent, address'd.</p>
<p>  Alcimedon! hold not the steeds remote<br />
But breathing on my back; for I expect<br />
That never Priame&iuml;an Hector's rage<span class="lnm">605</span><br />
Shall limit know, or pause, till, slaying us,<br />
He shall himself the coursers ample-maned<br />
Mount of Achilles, and to flight compel<br />
The Argive host, or perish in the van.</p>
<p>  So saying, he call'd aloud on Menelaus<span class="lnm">610</span><br />
With either Ajax. Oh, illustrious Chiefs<br />
Of Argos, Menelaus, and ye bold<br />
Ajaces!<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_17-9">[9]</a> leaving all your best to cope<br />
With Ilium's powers and to protect the dead,<br />
From friends still living ward the bitter day.<span class="lnm">615</span><br />
For hither borne, two Chiefs, bravest of all<br />
The Trojans, Hector and &AElig;neas rush<br />
Right through the battle. The events of war<br />
Heaven orders; therefore even I will give<br />
My spear its flight, and Jove dispose the rest!<span class="lnm">620</span></p>
<p>  He said, and brandishing his massy spear<br />
Dismiss'd it at Aretus; full he smote<br />
His ample shield, nor stay'd the pointed brass,<br />
But penetrating sheer the disk, his belt<br />
Pierced also, and stood planted in his waist.<span class="lnm">625</span><br />
As when some vigorous youth with sharpen'd axe<br />
A pastured bullock smites behind the horns<br />
And hews the muscle through; he, at the stroke<br />
Springs forth and falls, so sprang Aretus forth,<br />
Then fell supine, and in his bowels stood<span class="lnm">630</span><br />
The keen-edged lance still quivering till he died.<br />
Then Hector, in return, his radiant spear<br />
<span class="pgnm">441</span><a name="page_441" id="page_441"></a>
Hurl'd at Automedon, who of its flight<br />
Forewarn'd his body bowing prone, the stroke<br />
Eluded, and the spear piercing the soil<span class="lnm">635</span><br />
Behind him, shook to its superior end,<br />
Till, spent by slow degrees, its fury slept.<br />
And now, with hand to hilt, for closer war<br />
Both stood prepared, when through the multitude<br />
Advancing at their fellow-warrior's call,<span class="lnm">640</span><br />
The Ajaces suddenly their combat fierce<br />
Prevented. Awed at once by their approach<br />
Hector retired, with whom &AElig;neas went<br />
Also and godlike Chromius, leaving there<br />
Aretus with his vitals torn, whose arms,<span class="lnm">645</span><br />
Fierce as the God of war Automedon<br />
Stripp'd off, and thus exulted o'er the slain.</p>
<p>  My soul some portion of her grief resigns<br />
Consoled, although by slaughter of a worse,<br />
For loss of valiant Men&oelig;tiades.<span class="lnm">650</span></p>
<p>  So saying, within his chariot he disposed<br />
The gory spoils, then mounted it himself<br />
With hands and feet purpled, as from a bull<br />
His bloody prey, some lion newly-gorged.</p>
<p>  And now around Patroclus raged again<span class="lnm">655</span><br />
Dread strife deplorable! for from the skies<br />
Descending at the Thunderer's command<br />
Whose purpose now was to assist the Greeks,<br />
Pallas enhanced the fury of the fight.<br />
As when from heaven, in view of mortals, Jove<span class="lnm">660</span><br />
Exhibits bright his bow, a sign ordain'd<br />
Of war, or numbing frost which all the works<br />
Suspends of man and saddens all the flocks;<br />
So she, all mantled with a radiant cloud<br />
Entering Achaia's host, fired every breast.<span class="lnm">665</span><br />
But meeting Menelaus first, brave son<br />
Of Atreus, in the form and with the voice<br />
Robust of Ph&oelig;nix, him she thus bespake.</p>
<p>  Shame, Menelaus, shall to thee redound<br />
For ever, and reproach, should dogs devour<span class="lnm">670</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">442</span><a name="page_442" id="page_442"></a>
The faithful friend of Peleus' noble son<br />
Under Troy's battlements; but stand, thyself,<br />
Undaunted, and encourage all the host.</p>
<p>  To whom the son of Atreus bold in arms.<br />
Ah, Ph&oelig;nix, friend revered, ancient and sage!<span class="lnm">675</span><br />
Would Pallas give me might and from the dint<br />
Shield me of dart and spear, with willing mind<br />
I would defend Patroclus, for his death<br />
Hath touch'd me deep. But Hector with the rage<br />
Burns of consuming fire, nor to his spear<span class="lnm">680</span><br />
Gives pause, for him Jove leads to victory.</p>
<p>  He ceased, whom Pallas, Goddess azure-eyed<br />
Hearing, rejoiced that of the heavenly powers<br />
He had invoked <i>her</i> foremost to his aid.<br />
His shoulders with new might, and limbs she fill'd,<span class="lnm">685</span><br />
And persevering boldness to his breast<br />
Imparted, such as prompts the fly, which oft<br />
From flesh of man repulsed, her purpose yet<br />
To bite holds fast, resolved on human blood.<br />
His stormy bosom with such courage fill'd<span class="lnm">690</span><br />
By Pallas, to Patroclus he approach'd<br />
And hurl'd, incontinent, his glittering spear.<br />
There was a Trojan Chief, Podes by name,<br />
Son of E&euml;tion, valorous and rich;<br />
Of all Troy's citizens him Hector most<span class="lnm">695</span><br />
Respected, in convivial pleasures sweet<br />
His chosen companion. As he sprang to flight,<br />
The hero of the golden locks his belt<br />
Struck with full force and sent the weapon through.<br />
Sounding he fell, and from the Trojan ranks<span class="lnm">700</span><br />
Atrides dragg'd the body to his own.<br />
Then drew Apollo near to Hector's side,<br />
And in the form of Ph&oelig;nops, Asius' son,<br />
Of all the foreign guests at Hector's board<br />
His favorite most, the hero thus address'd.<span class="lnm">705</span></p>
<p>  What Chief of all the Grecians shall henceforth<br />
Fear Hector, who from Menelaus shrinks<br />
Once deem'd effeminate, but dragging now<br />
<span class="pgnm">443</span><a name="page_443" id="page_443"></a>
The body of thy valiant friend approved<br />
Whom he hath slain, Podes, E&euml;tion's son?<span class="lnm">710</span></p>
<p>  He spake, and at his words grief like a cloud<br />
Involved the mind of Hector dark around;<br />
Right through the foremost combatants he rush'd<br />
All clad in dazzling brass. Then, lifting high<br />
His tassel'd &AElig;gis radiant, Jove with storms<span class="lnm">715</span><br />
Enveloped Ida; flash'd his lightnings, roar'd<br />
His thunders, and the mountain shook throughout.<br />
Troy's host he prosper'd, and the Greeks dispersed.</p>
<p>  First fled Peneleus, the B&oelig;otian Chief,<br />
Whom facing firm the foe Polydamas<span class="lnm">720</span><br />
Struck on his shoulder's summit with a lance<br />
Hurl'd nigh at hand, which slight inscribed the bone.<br />
<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_17-10">[10]</a>Le&iuml;tus also, son of the renown'd<br />
Alectryon, pierced by Hector in the wrist,<br />
Disabled left the fight; trembling he fled<span class="lnm">725</span><br />
And peering narrowly around, nor hoped<br />
To lift a spear against the Trojans more.<br />
Hector, pursuing Le&iuml;tus, the point<br />
Encounter'd of the brave Idomeneus<br />
Full on his chest; but in his mail the lance<span class="lnm">730</span><br />
Snapp'd, and the Trojans shouted to the skies.<br />
He, in his turn, cast at Deucalion's son<br />
Idomeneus, who in that moment gain'd<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_17-11">[11]</a><br />
A chariot-seat; but him the erring spear<br />
Attain'd not, piercing C&oelig;ranus instead<span class="lnm">735</span><br />
The friend and follower of Meriones<br />
From wealthy Lyctus, and his charioteer.<br />
For when he left, that day, the gallant barks<br />
<span class="pgnm">444</span><a name="page_444" id="page_444"></a>
Idomeneus had sought the field on foot,<br />
And triumph proud, full sure, to Ilium's host<span class="lnm">740</span><br />
Had yielded now, but that with rapid haste<br />
C&oelig;ranus drove to his relief, from him<br />
The fate averting which himself incurr'd<br />
Victim of Hector's homicidal arm.<br />
Him Hector smiting between ear and jaw<span class="lnm">745</span><br />
Push'd from their sockets with the lance's point<br />
His firm-set teeth, and sever'd sheer his tongue.<br />
Dismounted down he fell, and from his hand<br />
Let slide the flowing reins, which, to the earth<br />
Stooping, Meriones in haste resumed,<span class="lnm">750</span><br />
And briefly thus Idomeneus address'd.</p>
<p>  Now drive, and cease not, to the fleet of Greece!<br />
Thyself see'st victory no longer ours.</p>
<p>  He said; Idomeneus whom, now, dismay<br />
Seized also, with his lash plying severe<span class="lnm">755</span><br />
The coursers ample-maned, flew to the fleet.<br />
Nor Ajax, dauntless hero, not perceived,<br />
Nor Menelaus, by the sway of Jove<br />
The victory inclining fast to Troy,<br />
And thus the Telamonian Chief began.<span class="lnm">760</span></p>
<p>  Ah! who can be so blind as not to see<br />
The eternal Father, now, with his own hand<br />
Awarding glory to the Trojan host,<br />
Whose every spear flies, instant, to the mark<br />
Sent forth by brave or base? Jove guides them all,<span class="lnm">765</span><br />
While, ineffectual, ours fall to the ground.<br />
But haste, devise we of ourselves the means<br />
How likeliest we may bear Patroclus hence,<br />
And gladden, safe returning, all our friends,<br />
Who, hither looking anxious, hope have none<span class="lnm">770</span><br />
That we shall longer check the unconquer'd force<br />
Of hero-slaughtering Hector, but expect<br />
<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_17-12">[12]</a>To see him soon amid the fleet of Greece.<br />
<span class="pgnm">445</span><a name="page_445" id="page_445"></a>
Oh for some Grecian now to carry swift<br />
The tidings to Achilles' ear, untaught,<span class="lnm">775</span><br />
As I conjecture, yet the doleful news<br />
Of his Patroclus slain! but no such Greek<br />
May I discern, such universal gloom<br />
Both men and steeds envelops all around.<br />
Father of heaven and earth! deliver thou<span class="lnm">780</span><br />
Achaia's host from darkness; clear the skies;<br />
Give day; and (since thy sovereign will is such)<br />
Destruction with it&mdash;but oh give us day!<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_17-13">[13]</a></p>
<p>  He spake, whose tears Jove saw with pity moved,<br />
And chased the untimely shades; bright beam'd the sun<span class="lnm">785</span><br />
And the whole battle was display'd. Then spake<br />
The hero thus to Atreus' mighty son.</p>
<p>  Now noble Menelaus! looking forth,<br />
See if Antilochus be yet alive,<br />
Brave son of Nestor, whom exhort to fly<span class="lnm">790</span><br />
With tidings to Achilles, of the friend<br />
Whom most he loved, of his Patroclus slain.</p>
<p>  He ceased, nor Menelaus, dauntless Chief,<br />
That task refused, but went; yet neither swift<br />
Nor willing. As a lion leaves the stalls<span class="lnm">795</span><br />
Wearied himself with harassing the guard,<br />
Who, interdicting him his purposed prey,<br />
Watch all the night; he famish'd, yet again<br />
Comes furious on, but speeds not, kept aloof<br />
By spears from daring hands dismissed, but more<span class="lnm">800</span><br />
By flash of torches which, though fierce, he dreads,<br />
Till at the dawn, sullen he stalks away;<br />
So from Patroclus Menelaus went<br />
Heroic Chief! reluctant; for he fear'd<br />
Lest the Achaians should resign the dead,<span class="lnm">805</span><br />
Through consternation, to the host of Troy.<br />
Departing, therefore, he admonish'd oft<br />
<span class="pgnm">446</span><a name="page_446" id="page_446"></a>
Meriones and the Ajaces, thus.</p>
<p>  Ye two brave leaders of the Argive host,<br />
And thou, Meriones! now recollect<span class="lnm">810</span><br />
The gentle manners of Patroclus fallen<br />
Hapless in battle, who by carriage mild<br />
Well understood, while yet he lived, to engage<br />
All hearts, through prisoner now of death and fate.</p>
<p>  So saying, the hero amber-hair'd his steps<span class="lnm">815</span><br />
Turn'd thence, the field exploring with an eye<br />
Sharp as the eagle's, of all fowls beneath<br />
The azure heavens for keenest sight renown'd,<br />
Whom, though he soar sublime, the leveret<br />
By broadest leaves conceal'd 'scapes not, but swift<span class="lnm">820</span><br />
Descending, even her he makes his prey;<br />
So, noble Menelaus! were thine eyes<br />
Turn'd into every quarter of the host<br />
In search of Nestor's son, if still he lived.<br />
Him, soon, encouraging his band to fight,<span class="lnm">825</span><br />
He noticed on the left of all the field,<br />
And sudden standing at his side, began.</p>
<p>  Antilochus! oh hear me, noble friend!<br />
And thou shalt learn tidings of such a deed<br />
As best had never been. Thou know'st, I judge,<span class="lnm">830</span><br />
And hast already seen, how Jove exalts<br />
To victory the Trojan host, and rolls<br />
Distress on ours; but ah! Patroclus lies,<br />
Our chief Achaian, slain, whose loss the Greeks<br />
Fills with regret. Haste, therefore, to the fleet,<span class="lnm">835</span><br />
Inform Achilles; bid him haste to save,<br />
If save he can, the body of his friend;<br />
He can no more, for Hector hath his arms.</p>
<p>  He ceased. Antilochus with horror heard<br />
Those tidings; mute long time he stood, his eyes<span class="lnm">840</span><br />
Swam tearful, and his voice, sonorous erst,<br />
Found utterance none. Yet even so distress'd,<br />
He not the more neglected the command<br />
Of Menelaus. Setting forth to run,<br />
He gave his armor to his noble friend<span class="lnm">845</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">447</span><a name="page_447" id="page_447"></a>
Laodocus, who thither turn'd his steeds,<br />
And weeping as he went, on rapid feet<br />
Sped to Achilles with that tale of wo.</p>
<p>  Nor could the noble Menelaus stay<br />
To give the weary Pylian band, bereft<span class="lnm">850</span><br />
Of their beloved Antilochus, his aid,<br />
But leaving them to Thrasymedes' care,<br />
He flew to Men&oelig;tiades again,<br />
And the Ajaces, thus, instant bespake.</p>
<p>  He goes. I have dispatch'd him to the fleet<span class="lnm">855</span><br />
To seek Achilles; but his coming naught<br />
Expect I now, although with rage he burn<br />
Against illustrious Hector; for what fight<br />
Can he, unarm'd, against the Trojans wage?<br />
Deliberating, therefore, frame we means<span class="lnm">860</span><br />
How best to save Patroclus, and to 'scape<br />
Ourselves unslain from this disastrous field.</p>
<p>  Whom answer'd the vast son of Telamon.<br />
Most noble Menelaus! good is all<br />
Which thou hast spoken. Lift ye from the earth<span class="lnm">865</span><br />
Thou and Meriones, at once, and bear<br />
The dead Patroclus from the bloody field.<br />
To cope meantime with Hector and his host<br />
Shall be our task, who, one in name, nor less<br />
In spirit one, already have the brunt<span class="lnm">870</span><br />
Of much sharp conflict, side by side, sustain'd.</p>
<p>  He ended; they enfolding in their arms<br />
The dead, upbore him high above the ground<br />
With force united; after whom the host<br />
Of Troy, seeing the body borne away,<span class="lnm">875</span><br />
Shouted, and with impetuous onset all<br />
Follow'd them. As the hounds, urged from behind<br />
By youthful hunters, on the wounded boar<br />
Make fierce assault; awhile at utmost speed<br />
They stretch toward him hungering, for the prey,<span class="lnm">880</span><br />
But oft as, turning sudden, the stout brawn<br />
Faces them, scatter'd on all sides escape;<br />
The Trojans so, thick thronging in the rear,<br />
<span class="pgnm">448</span><a name="page_448" id="page_448"></a>
Ceaseless with falchions and spears double-edged<br />
Annoy'd them sore, but oft as in retreat<span class="lnm">885</span><br />
The dauntless heroes, the Ajaces turn'd<br />
To face them, deadly wan grew every cheek,<br />
And not a Trojan dared with onset rude<br />
Molest them more in conflict for the dead.</p>
<p>  Thus they, laborious, forth from battle bore<span class="lnm">890</span><br />
Patroclus to the fleet, tempestuous war<br />
Their steps attending, rapid as the flames<br />
Which, kindled suddenly, some city waste;<br />
Consumed amid the blaze house after house<br />
Sinks, and the wind, meantime, roars through the fire;<span class="lnm">895</span><br />
So them a deafening tumult as they went<br />
Pursued, of horses and of men spear-arm'd.<br />
And as two mules with strength for toil endued,<br />
Draw through rough ways down from the distant hills<br />
Huge timber, beam or mast; sweating they go,<span class="lnm">900</span><br />
And overlabor'd to faint weariness;<br />
So they the body bore, while, turning oft,<br />
The Ajaces check'd the Trojans. As a mound<br />
Planted with trees and stretch'd athwart the mead<br />
Repels an overflow; the torrents loud<span class="lnm">905</span><br />
Baffling, it sends them far away to float<br />
The level land, nor can they with the force<br />
Of all their waters burst a passage through;<br />
So the Ajaces, constant, in the rear<br />
Repress'd the Trojans; but the Trojans them<span class="lnm">910</span><br />
Attended still, of whom &AElig;neas most<br />
Troubled them, and the glorious Chief of Troy.<br />
They as a cloud of starlings or of daws<br />
Fly screaming shrill, warn'd timely of the kite<br />
Or hawk, devourers of the smaller kinds,<span class="lnm">915</span><br />
So they shrill-clamoring toward the fleet,<br />
Hasted before &AElig;neas and the might<br />
Of Hector, nor the battle heeded more.<br />
Much radiant armor round about the foss<br />
Fell of the flying Grecians, or within<span class="lnm">920</span><br />
Lay scatter'd, and no pause of war they found.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="noind">Thus burn'd the battle like devouring fire.<br />
Meantime, Antilochus with rapid steps<br />
Came to Achilles. Him he found before<br />
His lofty barks, occupied, as he stood,<br />
With boding fears of all that had befall'n.<span class="lnm">5</span><br />
He groan'd, and to his noble self he said.</p>
<p>  Ah! wo is me&mdash;why falls Achaia's host,<br />
With such disorder foul, back on the fleet?<br />
I tremble lest the Gods my anxious thoughts<br />
Accomplish and my mother's words, who erst<span class="lnm">10</span><br />
Hath warn'd me, that the bravest and the best<br />
Of all my Myrmidons, while yet I live,<br />
Slain under Troy, must view the sun no more.<br />
Brave Men&oelig;tiades is, doubtless, slain.<br />
Unhappy friend! I bade thee oft, our barks<span class="lnm">15</span><br />
Deliver'd once from hostile fires, not seek<br />
To cope in arms with Hector, but return.</p>
<p>  While musing thus he stood, the son approach'd<br />
Of noble Nestor, and with tears his cheeks<br />
Bedewing copious, his sad message told.<span class="lnm">20</span></p>
<p>  Oh son of warlike Peleus! thou shalt hear<br />
Tidings of deeds which best had never been.<br />
Patroclus is no more. The Grecians fight<br />
For his bare corse, and Hector hath his arms.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_18-1">[1]</a></p>
<p><span class="pgnm">452</span><a name="page_452" id="page_452"></a>
  Then clouds of sorrow fell on Peleus' son,<span class="lnm">25</span><br />
And, grasping with both hands the ashes, down<br />
He pour'd them on his head, his graceful brows<br />
Dishonoring, and thick the sooty shower<br />
Descending settled on his fragrant vest.<br />
Then, stretch'd in ashes, at the vast extent<span class="lnm">30</span><br />
Of his whole length he lay, disordering wild<br />
With his own hands, and rending off his hair.<br />
The maidens, captived by himself in war<br />
And by Patroclus, shrieking from the tent<br />
Ran forth, and hemm'd the glorious Chief around.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_18-2">[2]</a><span class="lnm">35</span><br />
All smote their bosoms, and all, fainting, fell.<br />
On the other side, Antilochus the hands<br />
Held of Achilles, mourning and deep groans<br />
Uttering from his noble heart, through fear<br />
Lest Peleus' son should perish self-destroy'd.<span class="lnm">40</span><br />
Loud groan'd the hero, whose loud groans within<br />
The gulfs of ocean, where she sat beside<br />
Her ancient sire, his Goddess-mother heard,<br />
And hearing shriek'd; around her at the voice<br />
Assembled all the Nereids of the deep<span class="lnm">45</span><br />
Cymodoce, Thalia, Glauca came,<br />
Nis&aelig;a, Spio, Thoa, and with eyes<br />
Protuberant beauteous Halia; came with these<br />
Cymoth&ouml;e, and Act&aelig;a, and the nymph<br />
Of marshes, Limnorea, nor delay'd<span class="lnm">50</span><br />
Agave, nor Amphith&ouml;e the swift,<br />
I&aelig;ra, Doto, Melita, nor thence<br />
Was absent Proto or Dynamene,<br />
Callianira, Doris, Panope,<br />
Pherusa or Amphinome, or fair<span class="lnm">55</span><br />
Dexamene, or Galatea praised<br />
For matchless form divine; Nemertes pure<br />
<span class="pgnm">453</span><a name="page_453" id="page_453"></a>
Came also, with Apseudes crystal-bright,<br />
Callianassa, M&aelig;ra, Clymene,<br />
Janeira and Janassa, sister pair,<span class="lnm">60</span><br />
And Orithya and with azure locks<br />
Luxuriant, Amathea; nor alone<br />
Came these, but every ocean-nymph beside,<br />
The silver cave was fill'd; each smote her breast,<br />
And Thetis, loud lamenting, thus began.<span class="lnm">65</span></p>
<p>  Ye sister Nereids, hear! that ye may all<br />
From my own lips my boundless sorrow learn.<br />
Ah me forlorn! ah me, parent in vain<br />
Of an illustrious birth! who, having borne<br />
A noble son magnanimous, the chief<span class="lnm">70</span><br />
Of heroes, saw him like a thriving plant<br />
Shoot vigorous under my maternal care,<br />
And sent him early in his gallant fleet<br />
Embark'd, to combat with the sons of Troy.<br />
But him from fight return'd I shall receive<span class="lnm">75</span><br />
Beneath the roof of Peleus, never more;<br />
And while he lives, and on the sun his eyes<br />
Opens, he mourns, nor, going, can I aught<br />
Assist him; yet I go, that I may see<br />
My darling son, and from his lips be taught<span class="lnm">80</span><br />
What grief hath now befallen him, who close<br />
Abiding in his tent shares not the war.<br />
So saying she left the cave, whom all her nymphs<br />
Attended weeping, and where'er they pass'd<br />
The breaking billows open'd wide a way.<span class="lnm">85</span><br />
At fruitful Troy arrived, in order fair<br />
They climb'd the beach, where by his numerous barks<br />
Encompass'd, swift Achilles sighing lay.<br />
Then, drawing nigh to her afflicted son,<br />
The Goddess-mother press'd between her palms<span class="lnm">90</span><br />
His temples, and in accents wing'd inquired.</p>
<p>  Why weeps my son? what sorrow wrings thy soul?<br />
Speak, hide it not. Jove hath fulfill'd the prayer<br />
Which erst with lifted hands thou didst prefer,<br />
That all Achaia's host, wanting thy aid,<span class="lnm">95</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">454</span><a name="page_454" id="page_454"></a>
Might be compell'd into the fleet, and foul<br />
Disgrace incur, there prison'd for thy sake.</p>
<p>  To whom Achilles, groaning deep, replied.<br />
My mother! it is true; Olympian Jove<br />
That prayer fulfils; but thence, what joy to me,<span class="lnm">100</span><br />
Patroclus slain? the friend of all my friends<br />
Whom most I loved, dear to me as my life&mdash;<br />
Him I have lost. Slain and despoil'd he lies<br />
By Hector of his glorious armor bright,<br />
The wonder of all eyes, a matchless gift<span class="lnm">105</span><br />
Given by the Gods to Peleus on that day<br />
When thee they doom'd into a mortal's arms.<br />
Oh that with these thy deathless ocean-nymphs<br />
Dwelling content, thou hadst my father left<br />
To espouse a mortal bride, so hadst thou 'scaped<span class="lnm">110</span><br />
Pangs numberless which thou must now endure<br />
For thy son's death, whom thou shalt never meet<br />
From Troy return'd, in Peleus' mansion more!<br />
For life I covet not, nor longer wish<br />
To mix with human kind, unless my spear<span class="lnm">115</span><br />
May find out Hector, and atonement take<br />
By slaying him, for my Patroclus slain.</p>
<p>  To whom, with streaming tears, Thetis replied.<br />
Swift comes thy destiny as thou hast said,<br />
For after Hector's death thine next ensues.<span class="lnm">120</span></p>
<p>  Then answer, thus, indignant he return'd.<br />
Death, seize me now! since when my friend was slain,<br />
My doom was, not to succor him. He died<br />
From home remote, and wanting me to save him.<br />
Now, therefore, since I neither visit more<span class="lnm">125</span><br />
My native land, nor, present here, have aught<br />
Avail'd Patroclus or my many friends<br />
Whom noble Hector hath in battle slain,<br />
But here I sit unprofitable grown,<br />
Earth's burden, though of such heroic note,<span class="lnm">130</span><br />
If not in council foremost (for I yield<br />
That prize to others) yet in feats of arms,<br />
Such as none other in Achaia's host,<br />
<span class="pgnm">455</span><a name="page_455" id="page_455"></a>
May fierce contention from among the Gods<br />
Perish, and from among the human race,<span class="lnm">135</span><br />
With wrath, which sets the wisest hearts on fire;<br />
Sweeter than dropping honey to the taste,<br />
But in the bosom of mankind, a smoke!<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_18-3">[3]</a><br />
Such was my wrath which Agamemnon roused,<br />
The king of men. But since the past is fled<span class="lnm">140</span><br />
Irrevocable, howsoe'er distress'd,<br />
Renounce we now vain musings on the past,<br />
Content through sad necessity. I go<br />
In quest of noble Hector, who hath slain<br />
My loved Patroclus, and such death will take<span class="lnm">145</span><br />
As Jove ordains me and the Powers of Heaven<br />
At their own season, send it when they may.<br />
For neither might the force of Hercules,<br />
Although high-favored of Saturnian Jove,<br />
From death escape, but Fate and the revenge<span class="lnm">150</span><br />
Restless of Juno vanquish'd even Him.<br />
I also, if a destiny like his<br />
Await me, shall, like him, find rest in death;<br />
But glory calls me now; now will I make<br />
Some Trojan wife or Dardan with both hands<span class="lnm">155</span><br />
Wipe her soft cheeks, and utter many a groan.<br />
Long time have I been absent from the field,<br />
And they shall know it. Love me as thou may'st,<br />
Yet thwart me not, for I am fixt to go.</p>
<p>  Whom Thetis answer'd, Goddess of the Deep.<span class="lnm">160</span><br />
Thou hast well said, my son! it is no blame<br />
To save from threaten'd death our suffering friends.<br />
But thy magnificent and dazzling arms<br />
Are now in Trojan hands; them Hector wears<br />
<span class="pgnm">456</span><a name="page_456" id="page_456"></a>
Exulting, but ordain'd not long to exult,<span class="lnm">165</span><br />
So habited; his death is also nigh.<br />
But thou with yonder warring multitudes<br />
Mix not till thou behold me here again;<br />
For with the rising sun I will return<br />
To-morrow, and will bring thee glorious arms,<span class="lnm">170</span><br />
By Vulcan forged himself, the King of fire.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_18-4">[4]</a></p>
<p>  She said, and turning from her son aside,<br />
The sisterhood of Ocean thus address'd.</p>
<p>  Plunge ye again into the briny Deep,<br />
And to the hoary Sovereign of the floods<span class="lnm">175</span><br />
Report as ye have heard. I to the heights<br />
Olympian haste, that I may there obtain<br />
From Vulcan, glorious artist of the skies,<br />
Arms of excelling beauty for my son.</p>
<p>  She said; they plunged into the waves again,<span class="lnm">180</span><br />
And silver-footed Thetis, to the heights<br />
Olympian soaring swiftly to obtain<br />
Arms for renown'd Achilles, disappear'd.</p>
<p>  Meantime, with infinite uproar the Greeks<br />
From Hector's hero-slaying arm had fled<span class="lnm">185</span><br />
Home to their galleys station'd on the banks<br />
Of Hellespont. Nor yet Achaia's sons<br />
Had borne the body of Patroclus clear<br />
From flight of darts away, but still again<br />
The multitude of warriors and of steeds<span class="lnm">190</span><br />
Came on, by Priameian Hector led<br />
Rapid as fire. Thrice noble Hector seized<br />
His ancles from behind, ardent to drag<br />
Patroclus, calling to his host the while;<br />
But thrice, the two Ajaces, clothed with might,<span class="lnm">195</span><br />
Shock'd and repulsed him reeling. He with force<br />
Fill'd indefatigable, through his ranks<br />
Issuing, by turns assail'd them, and by turns<br />
<span class="pgnm">457</span><a name="page_457" id="page_457"></a>
Stood clamoring, yet not a step retired;<br />
But as the hinds deter not from his prey<span class="lnm">200</span><br />
A tawny lion by keen hunger urged,<br />
So would not both Ajaces, warriors bold,<br />
Intimidate and from the body drive<br />
Hector; and he had dragg'd him thence and won<br />
Immortal glory, but that Iris, sent<span class="lnm">205</span><br />
Unseen by Jove and by the powers of heaven,<br />
From Juno, to Achilles brought command<br />
That he should show himself. Full near she drew,<br />
And in wing'd accents thus the Chief address'd.</p>
<p>  Hero! most terrible of men, arise!<span class="lnm">210</span><br />
protect Patroclus, for whose sake the war<br />
Stands at the fleet of Greece. Mutual prevails<br />
The slaughter, these the dead defending, those<br />
Resolute hence to drag him to the gates<br />
Of wind-swept Ilium. But beyond them all<span class="lnm">215</span><br />
Illustrious Hector, obstinate is bent<br />
To win him, purposing to lop his head,<br />
And to exhibit it impaled on high.<br />
Thou then arise, nor longer on the ground<br />
Lie stretch'd inactive; let the thought with shame<span class="lnm">220</span><br />
Touch thee, of thy Patroclus made the sport<br />
Of Trojan dogs, whose corse, if it return<br />
Dishonored home, brings with it thy reproach.</p>
<p>  To whom Achilles matchless in the race.<br />
Iris divine! of all the Gods, who sent thee?<span class="lnm">225</span></p>
<p>  Then, thus, the swift ambassadress of heaven.<br />
By Juno sent I come, consort of Jove.<br />
Nor knows Saturnian Jove high-throned, himself,<br />
My flight, nor any of the Immortal Powers,<br />
Tenants of the Olympian heights snow-crown'd.<span class="lnm">230</span></p>
<p>  Her answer'd then Pelides, glorious Chief.<br />
How shall I seek the fight? they have my arms.<br />
My mother charged me also to abstain<br />
From battle, till she bring me armor new<br />
Which she hath promised me from Vulcan's hand.<span class="lnm">235</span><br />
Meantime, whose armor else might serve my need<br />
<span class="pgnm">458</span><a name="page_458" id="page_458"></a>
I know not, save perhaps alone the shield<br />
Of Telamonian Ajax, whom I deem<br />
Himself now busied in the stormy van,<br />
Slaying the Trojans in my friend's defence.<span class="lnm">240</span></p>
<p>  To whom the swift-wing'd messenger of heaven,<br />
Full well we know thine armor Hector's prize<br />
Yet, issuing to the margin of the foss,<br />
Show thyself only. Panic-seized, perchance,<br />
The Trojans shall from fight desist, and yield<span class="lnm">245</span><br />
To the o'ertoil'd though dauntless sons of Greece<br />
Short respite; it is all that war allows.</p>
<p>  So saying, the storm-wing'd Iris disappear'd.<br />
Then rose at once Achilles dear to Jove,<br />
Athwart whose shoulders broad Minerva cast<span class="lnm">250</span><br />
Her &AElig;gis fringed terrific, and his brows<br />
Encircled with a golden cloud that shot<br />
Fires insupportable to sight abroad.<br />
As when some island, situate afar<br />
On the wide waves, invested all the day<span class="lnm">255</span><br />
By cruel foes from their own city pour'd,<br />
Upsends a smoke to heaven, and torches shows<br />
On all her turrets at the close of eve<br />
Which flash against the clouds, kindled in hope<br />
Of aid from neighbor maritime allies,<span class="lnm">260</span><br />
So from Achilles' head light flash'd to heaven.<br />
Issuing through the wall, beside the foss<br />
He stood, but mix'd not with Achaia's host,<br />
Obedient to his mother's wise command.<br />
He stood and shouted; Pallas also raised<span class="lnm">265</span><br />
A dreadful shout and tumult infinite<br />
Excited throughout all the host of Troy.<br />
Clear as the trumpet's note when it proclaims<br />
A numerous host approaching to invest<br />
Some city close around, so clear the voice<span class="lnm">270</span><br />
Rang of &AElig;acides, and tumult-toss'd<br />
Was every soul that heard the brazen tone.<br />
With swift recoil the long-maned coursers thrust<br />
The chariots back, all boding wo at hand,<br />
<span class="pgnm">459</span><a name="page_459" id="page_459"></a>
And every charioteer astonish'd saw<span class="lnm">275</span><br />
Fires that fail'd not, illumining the brows<br />
Of Peleus' son, by Pallas kindled there.<br />
Thrice o'er the trench Achilles sent his voice<br />
Sonorous, and confusion at the sound<br />
Thrice seized the Trojans, and their famed allies.<span class="lnm">280</span><br />
Twelve in that moment of their noblest died<br />
By their own spears and chariots, and with joy<br />
The Grecians from beneath a hill of darts<br />
Dragging Patroclus, placed him on his bier.<br />
Around him throng'd his fellow-warriors bold,<span class="lnm">285</span><br />
All weeping, after whom Achilles went<br />
Fast-weeping also at the doleful sight<br />
Of his true friend on his funereal bed<br />
Extended, gash'd with many a mortal wound,<br />
Whom he had sent into the fight with steeds<span class="lnm">290</span><br />
And chariot, but received him thence no more.</p>
<p>  And now majestic Juno sent the sun,<br />
Unwearied minister of light, although<br />
Reluctant, down into the Ocean stream.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_18-5">[5]</a><br />
So the sun sank, and the Achaians ceased<span class="lnm">295</span><br />
From the all-wasting labors of the war.<br />
On the other side, the Trojans, from the fight<br />
Retiring, loosed their steeds, but ere they took<br />
Thought of refreshment, in full council met.<br />
It was a council at which no man sat,<span class="lnm">300</span><br />
Or dared; all stood; such terror had on all<br />
Fallen, for that Achilles had appear'd,<br />
After long pause from battle's arduous toil.<br />
First rose Polydamas the prudent son<br />
Of Panthus, above all the Trojans skill'd<span class="lnm">305</span><br />
Both in futurity and in the past.<br />
He was the friend of Hector, and one night<br />
<span class="pgnm">460</span><a name="page_460" id="page_460"></a>
Gave birth to both. In council one excell'd<br />
And one still more in feats of high renown.<br />
Thus then, admonishing them, he began.<span class="lnm">310</span></p>
<p>  My friends! weigh well the occasion. Back to Troy<br />
By my advice, nor wait the sacred morn<br />
Here, on the plain, from Ilium's walls remote<br />
So long as yet the anger of this Chief<br />
'Gainst noble Agamemnon burn'd, so long<span class="lnm">315</span><br />
We found the Greeks less formidable foes,<br />
And I rejoiced, myself, spending the night<br />
Beside their oary barks, for that I hoped<br />
To seize them; but I now tremble at thought<br />
Of Peleus' rapid son again in arms.<span class="lnm">320</span><br />
A spirit proud as his will scorn to fight<br />
Here, on the plain, where Greeks and Trojans take<br />
Their common share of danger and of toil,<br />
And will at once strike at your citadel,<br />
Impatient till he make your wives his prey.<span class="lnm">325</span><br />
Haste&mdash;let us home&mdash;else thus shall it befall;<br />
Night's balmy influence in his tent detains<br />
Achilles now, but rushing arm'd abroad<br />
To-morrow, should he find us lingering here,<br />
None shall mistake him then; happy the man<span class="lnm">330</span><br />
Who soonest, then, shall 'scape to sacred Troy!<br />
Then, dogs shall make and vultures on our flesh<br />
Plenteous repast. Oh spare mine ears the tale!<br />
But if, though troubled, ye can yet receive<br />
My counsel, thus assembled we will keep<span class="lnm">335</span><br />
Strict guard to-night; meantime, her gates and towers<br />
With all their mass of solid timbers, smooth<br />
And cramp'd with bolts of steel, will keep the town.<br />
But early on the morrow we will stand<br />
All arm'd on Ilium's towers. Then, if he choose,<span class="lnm">340</span><br />
His galleys left, to compass Troy about,<br />
He shall be task'd enough; his lofty steeds<br />
Shall have their fill of coursing to and fro<br />
Beneath, and gladly shall to camp return.<br />
But waste the town he shall not, nor attempt<span class="lnm">345</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">461</span><a name="page_461" id="page_461"></a>
With all the utmost valor that he boasts<br />
To force a pass; dogs shall devour him first.</p>
<p>  To whom brave Hector louring, and in wrath.<br />
Polydamas, I like not thy advice<br />
Who bidd'st us in our city skulk, again<span class="lnm">350</span><br />
Imprison'd there. Are ye not yet content?<br />
Wish ye for durance still in your own towers?<br />
Time was, when in all regions under heaven<br />
Men praised the wealth of Priam's city stored<br />
With gold and brass; but all our houses now<span class="lnm">355</span><br />
Stand emptied of their hidden treasures rare.<br />
Jove in his wrath hath scatter'd them; our wealth<br />
Is marketed, and Phrygia hath a part<br />
Purchased, and part M&aelig;onia's lovely land.<br />
But since the son of wily Saturn old<span class="lnm">360</span><br />
Hath given me glory now, and to inclose<br />
The Grecians in their fleet hemm'd by the sea,<br />
Fool! taint not with such talk the public mind.<br />
For not a Trojan here will thy advice<br />
Follow, or shall; it hath not my consent.<span class="lnm">365</span><br />
But thus I counsel. Let us, band by band,<br />
Throughout the host take supper, and let each,<br />
Guarded against nocturnal danger, watch.<br />
And if a Trojan here be rack'd in mind<br />
Lest his possessions perish, let him cast<span class="lnm">370</span><br />
His golden heaps into the public maw,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_18-6">[6]</a><br />
Far better so consumed than by the Greeks.<br />
Then, with the morrow's dawn, all fair array'd<br />
In battle, we will give them at their fleet<br />
Sharp onset, and if Peleus' noble son<span class="lnm">375</span><br />
Have risen indeed to conflict for the ships,<br />
The worse for him. I shall not for his sake<br />
Avoid the deep-toned battle, but will firm<br />
Oppose his utmost. Either he shall gain<br />
Or I, great glory. Mars his favors deals<span class="lnm">380</span><br />
Impartial, and the slayer oft is slain.<br />
So counsell'd Hector, whom with shouts of praise<br />
<span class="pgnm">462</span><a name="page_462" id="page_462"></a>
The Trojans answer'd:&mdash;fools, and by the power<br />
Of Pallas of all sober thought bereft!<br />
For all applauded Hector, who had given<span class="lnm">385</span><br />
Advice pernicious, and Polydamas,<br />
Whose counsel was discreet and wholesome none.<br />
So then they took repast. But all night long<br />
The Grecians o'er Patroclus wept aloud,<br />
While, standing in the midst, Pelides led<span class="lnm">390</span><br />
The lamentation, heaving many a groan,<br />
And on the bosom of his breathless friend<br />
Imposing, sad, his homicidal hands.<br />
As the grim lion, from whose gloomy lair<br />
Among thick trees the hunter hath his whelps<span class="lnm">395</span><br />
Purloin'd, too late returning mourns his loss,<br />
Then, up and down, the length of many a vale<br />
Courses, exploring fierce the robber's foot,<br />
Incensed as he, and with a sigh deep-drawn<br />
Thus to his Myrmidons Achilles spake.<span class="lnm">400</span></p>
<p>  How vain, alas! my word spoken that day<br />
At random, when to soothe the hero's fears<br />
Men&oelig;tius, then our guest, I promised him<br />
His noble son at Opoeis again,<br />
Living and laden with the spoils of Troy!<span class="lnm">405</span><br />
But Jove performs not all the thoughts of man,<br />
For we were both destined to tinge the soil<br />
Of Ilium with our blood, nor I shall see,<br />
Myself, my father in his mansion more<br />
Or Thetis, but must find my burial here.<span class="lnm">410</span><br />
Yet, my Patroclus! since the earth expects<br />
Me next, I will not thy funereal rites<br />
Finish, till I shall bring both head and arms<br />
Of that bold Chief who slew thee, to my tent.<br />
I also will smite off, before thy pile,<span class="lnm">415</span><br />
The heads of twelve illustrious sons of Troy,<br />
Resentful of thy death. Meantime, among<br />
My lofty galleys thou shalt lie, with tears<br />
Mourn'd day and night by Trojan captives fair<br />
And Dardan compassing thy bier around,<span class="lnm">420</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">463</span><a name="page_463" id="page_463"></a>
Whom we, at price of labor hard, ourselves<br />
With massy spears toiling in battle took<br />
From many an opulent city, now no more.</p>
<p>  So saying, he bade his train surround with fire<br />
A tripod huge, that they might quickly cleanse<span class="lnm">425</span><br />
Patroclus from all stain of clotted gore.<br />
They on the blazing hearth a tripod placed<br />
Capacious, fill'd with water its wide womb,<br />
And thrust dry wood beneath, till, fierce, the flames<br />
Embraced it round, and warm'd the flood within.<span class="lnm">430</span><br />
Soon as the water in the singing brass<br />
Simmer'd, they bathed him, and with limpid oil<br />
Anointed; filling, next, his ruddy wounds<br />
With unguent mellow'd by nine circling years,<br />
They stretch'd him on his bed, then cover'd him<span class="lnm">435</span><br />
From head to feet with linen texture light,<br />
And with a wide unsullied mantle, last.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_18-7">[7]</a><br />
All night the Myrmidons around the swift<br />
Achilles stood, deploring loud his friend,<br />
And Jove his spouse and sister thus bespake.<span class="lnm">440</span></p>
<p>  So then, Imperial Juno! not in vain<br />
Thou hast the swift Achilles sought to rouse<br />
Again to battle; the Achaians, sure,<br />
Are thy own children, thou hast borne them all.</p>
<p>  To whom the awful Goddess ample-eyed.<span class="lnm">445</span><br />
What word hath pass'd thy lips, Jove, most severe?<br />
A man, though mortal merely, and to me<br />
Inferior in device, might have achieved<br />
That labor easily. Can I who boast<br />
Myself the chief of Goddesses, and such<span class="lnm">450</span><br />
Not by birth only, but as thine espoused,<br />
Who art thyself sovereign of all the Gods,<br />
Can I with anger burn against the house<br />
Of Priam, and want means of just revenge?</p>
<p><span class="pgnm">464</span><a name="page_464" id="page_464"></a>
  Thus they in heaven their mutual conference<span class="lnm">455</span><br />
Meantime, the silver-footed Thetis reach'd<br />
The starr'd abode eternal, brazen wall'd<br />
Of Vulcan, by the builder lame himself<br />
Uprear'd, a wonder even in eyes divine.<br />
She found him sweating, at his bellows huge<span class="lnm">460</span><br />
Toiling industrious; tripods bright he form'd<br />
Twenty at once, his palace-wall to grace<br />
Ranged in harmonious order. Under each<br />
Two golden wheels he set, on which (a sight<br />
Marvellous!) into council they should roll<span class="lnm">465</span><br />
Self-moved, and to his house, self-moved, return.<br />
Thus far the work was finish'd, but not yet<br />
Their ears of exquisite design affixt,<br />
For them he stood fashioning, and prepared<br />
The rivets. While he thus his matchless skill<span class="lnm">470</span><br />
Employ'd laborious, to his palace-gate<br />
The silver-footed Thetis now advanced,<br />
Whom Charis, Vulcan's well-attired spouse,<br />
Beholding from the palace portal, flew<br />
To seize the Goddess' hand, and thus inquired.<span class="lnm">475</span></p>
<p>  Why, Thetis! worthy of all reverence<br />
And of all love, comest thou to our abode,<br />
Unfrequent here? But enter, and accept<br />
Such welcome as to such a guest is due.</p>
<p>  So saying, she introduced and to a seat<span class="lnm">480</span><br />
Led her with argent studs border'd around<br />
And foot-stool'd sumptuously;<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_18-8">[8]</a> then, calling forth<br />
Her spouse, the glorious artist, thus she said.</p>
<p>  Haste, Vulcan! Thetis wants thee; linger not.<br />
To whom the artist of the skies replied.<span class="lnm">485</span></p>
<p>  A Goddess then, whom with much cause I love<br />
And venerate is here, who when I fell<br />
Saved me, what time my shameless mother sought<br />
To cast me, because lame, out of all sight;<br />
<span class="pgnm">465</span><a name="page_465" id="page_465"></a>
Then had I been indeed forlorn, had not<span class="lnm">490</span><br />
Eurynome the daughter of the Deep<br />
And Thetis in their laps received me fallen.<br />
Nine years with them residing, for their use<br />
I form'd nice trinkets, clasps, rings, pipes, and chains,<br />
While loud around our hollow cavern roar'd<span class="lnm">495</span><br />
The surge of the vast deep, nor God nor man,<br />
Save Thetis and Eurynome, my life's<br />
Preservers, knew where I was kept conceal'd.<br />
Since, therefore, she is come, I cannot less<br />
Than recompense to Thetis amber-hair'd<span class="lnm">500</span><br />
With readiness the boon of life preserved.<br />
Haste, then, and hospitably spread the board<br />
For her regale, while with my best dispatch<br />
I lay my bellows and my tools aside.</p>
<p>  He spake, and vast in bulk and hot with toil<span class="lnm">505</span><br />
Rose limping from beside his anvil-stock<br />
Upborne, with pain on legs tortuous and weak.<br />
First, from the forge dislodged he thrust apart<br />
His bellows, and his tools collecting all<br />
Bestow'd them, careful, in a silver chest,<span class="lnm">510</span><br />
Then all around with a wet sponge he wiped<br />
His visage, and his arms and brawny neck<br />
Purified, and his shaggy breast from smutch;<br />
Last, putting on his vest, he took in hand<br />
His sturdy staff, and shuffled through the door.<span class="lnm">515</span><br />
Beside the King of fire two golden forms<br />
Majestic moved, that served him in the place<br />
Of handmaids; young they seem'd, and seem'd alive,<br />
Nor want they intellect, or speech, or force,<br />
Or prompt dexterity by the Gods inspired.<span class="lnm">520</span><br />
These his supporters were, and at his side<br />
Attendant diligent, while he, with gait<br />
Uncouth, approaching Thetis where she sat<br />
On a bright throne, seized fast her hand and said,</p>
<p>  Why, Thetis! worthy as thou art of love<span class="lnm">525</span><br />
And of all reverence, hast thou arrived,<br />
Unfrequent here? Speak&mdash;tell me thy desire,<br />
<span class="pgnm">466</span><a name="page_466" id="page_466"></a>
Nor doubt my services, if thou demand<br />
Things possible, and possible to me.</p>
<p>  Then Thetis, weeping plenteously, replied.<span class="lnm">530</span><br />
Oh Vulcan! Is there on Olympius' heights<br />
A Goddess with such load of sorrow press'd<br />
As, in peculiar, Jove assigns to me?<br />
Me only, of all ocean-nymphs, he made<br />
Spouse to a man, Peleus &AElig;acides,<span class="lnm">535</span><br />
Whose bed, although reluctant and perforce,<br />
I yet endured to share. He now, the prey<br />
Of cheerless age, decrepid lies, and Jove<br />
Still other woes heaps on my wretched head.<br />
He gave me to bring forth, gave me to rear<span class="lnm">540</span><br />
A son illustrious, valiant, and the chief<br />
Of heroes; he, like a luxuriant plant<br />
Upran<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_18-9">[9]</a> to manhood, while his lusty growth<br />
I nourish'd as the husbandman his vine<br />
Set in a fruitful field, and being grown<span class="lnm">545</span><br />
I sent him early in his gallant fleet<br />
Embark'd, to combat with the sons of Troy;<br />
But him from fight return'd I shall receive,<br />
Beneath the roof of Peleus, never more,<br />
And while he lives and on the sun his eyes<span class="lnm">550</span><br />
Opens, affliction is his certain doom,<br />
Nor aid resides or remedy in me.<br />
The virgin, his own portion of the spoils,<br />
Allotted to him by the Grecians&mdash;her<br />
Atrides, King of men, resumed, and grief<span class="lnm">555</span><br />
Devour'd Achilles' spirit for her sake.<br />
Meantime, the Trojans shutting close within<br />
Their camp the Grecians, have forbidden them<br />
All egress, and the senators of Greece<br />
Have sought with splendid gifts to soothe my son.<span class="lnm">560</span><br />
He, indisposed to rescue them himself<br />
From ruin, sent, instead, Patroclus forth,<br />
Clad in his own resplendent armor, Chief<br />
Of the whole host of Myrmidons. Before<br />
<span class="pgnm">467</span><a name="page_467" id="page_467"></a>
The Sc&aelig;an gate from morn to eve they fought,<span class="lnm">565</span><br />
And on that self-same day had Ilium fallen,<br />
But that Apollo, to advance the fame<br />
Of Hector, slew Men&oelig;tius' noble son<br />
Full-flush'd with victory. Therefore at thy knees<br />
Suppliant I fall, imploring from thine art<span class="lnm">570</span><br />
A shield and helmet, greaves of shapely form<br />
With clasps secured, and corselet for my son.<br />
For those, once his, his faithful friend hath lost,<br />
Slain by the Trojans, and Achilles lies,<br />
Himself, extended mournful on the ground.<span class="lnm">575</span></p>
<p>  Her answer'd then the artist of the skies.<br />
Courage! Perplex not with these cares thy soul.<br />
I would that when his fatal hour shall come,<br />
I could as sure secrete him from the stroke<br />
Of destiny, as he shall soon have arms<span class="lnm">580</span><br />
Illustrious, such as each particular man<br />
Of thousands, seeing them, shall wish his own.</p>
<p>  He said, and to his bellows quick repair'd,<br />
Which turning to the fire he bade them heave.<br />
Full twenty bellows working all at once<span class="lnm">595</span><br />
Breathed on the furnace, blowing easy and free<br />
The managed winds, now forcible, as best<br />
Suited dispatch, now gentle, if the will<br />
Of Vulcan and his labor so required.<br />
Impenetrable brass, tin, silver, gold,<span class="lnm">590</span><br />
He cast into the forge, then, settling firm<br />
His ponderous anvil on the block, one hand<br />
With his huge hammer fill'd, one with the tongs.</p>
<p>  <a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_18-10">[10]</a>He fashion'd first a shield massy and broad<br />
<span class="pgnm">468</span><a name="page_468" id="page_468"></a>
Of labor exquisite, for which he form'd<span class="lnm">595</span><br />
A triple border beauteous, dazzling bright,<br />
And loop'd it with a silver brace behind.<br />
The shield itself with five strong folds he forged,<br />
And with devices multiform the disk<br />
Capacious charged, toiling with skill divine.<span class="lnm">600</span></p>
<p>  There he described the earth, the heaven, the sea,<br />
The sun that rests not, and the moon full-orb'd.<br />
There also, all the stars which round about<br />
As with a radiant frontlet bind the skies,<br />
The Pleiads and the Hyads, and the might<span class="lnm">605</span><br />
Of huge Orion, with him Ursa call'd,<br />
Known also by his popular name, the Wain,<br />
That spins around the pole looking toward<br />
Orion, only star of these denied<br />
To slake his beams in ocean's briny baths.<span class="lnm">610</span></p>
<p>  Two splendid cities also there he form'd<br />
Such as men build. In one were to be seen<br />
Rites matrimonial solemnized with pomp<br />
Of sumptuous banquets; from their chambers forth<br />
Leading the brides they usher'd them along<span class="lnm">615</span><br />
With torches through the streets, and sweet was heard<br />
The voice around of Hymen&aelig;al song.<br />
Here striplings danced in circles to the sound<br />
Of pipe and harp, while in the portals stood<br />
Women, admiring, all, the gallant show.<span class="lnm">620</span><br />
Elsewhere was to be seen in council met<br />
The close-throng'd multitude. There strife arose.<br />
Two citizens contended for a mulct<br />
The price of blood. This man affirm'd the fine<br />
All paid,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_18-11">[11]</a> haranguing vehement the crowd,<span class="lnm">625</span><br />
That man denied that he had aught received,<br />
And to the judges each made his appeal<br />
Eager for their award. Meantime the people,<br />
<span class="pgnm">469</span><a name="page_469" id="page_469"></a>
As favor sway'd them, clamor'd loud for each.<br />
The heralds quell'd the tumult; reverend sat<span class="lnm">630</span><br />
On polish'd stones the elders in a ring,<br />
Each with a herald's sceptre in his hand,<br />
Which holding they arose, and all in turn<br />
Gave sentence. In the midst two talents lay<br />
Of gold, his destined recompense whose voice<span class="lnm">635</span><br />
Decisive should pronounce the best award.<br />
The other city by two glittering hosts<br />
Invested stood, and a dispute arose<br />
Between the hosts, whether to burn the town<br />
And lay all waste, or to divide the spoil.<span class="lnm">640</span><br />
Meantime, the citizens, still undismay'd,<br />
Surrender'd not the town, but taking arms<br />
Secretly, set the ambush in array,<br />
And on the walls their wives and children kept<br />
Vigilant guard, with all the ancient men.<span class="lnm">645</span><br />
They sallied; at their head Pallas and Mars<br />
Both golden and in golden vests attired<br />
Advanced, proportion each showing divine,<br />
Large, prominent, and such as Gods beseem'd.<br />
Not such the people, but of humbler size.<span class="lnm">650</span><br />
Arriving at the spot for ambush chosen,<br />
A river's side, where cattle of each kind<br />
Drank, down they sat, all arm'd in dazzling brass.<br />
Apart from all the rest sat also down<br />
Two spies, both looking for the flocks and herds.<span class="lnm">655</span><br />
Soon they appear'd, and at their side were seen<br />
Two shepherd swains, each playing on his pipe<br />
Careless, and of the danger nought apprized,<br />
Swift ran the spies, perceiving their approach,<br />
And intercepting suddenly the herds<span class="lnm">660</span><br />
And flocks of silver fleece, slew also those<br />
Who fed them. The besiegers, at that time<br />
In council, by the sound alarm'd, their steeds<br />
Mounted, and hasted, instant, to the place;<br />
Then, standing on the river's brink they fought<span class="lnm">665</span><br />
And push'd each other with the brazen lance.<br />
<span class="pgnm">470</span><a name="page_470" id="page_470"></a>
There Discord raged, there Tumult, and the force<br />
Of ruthless Destiny; she now a Chief<br />
Seized newly wounded, and now captive held<br />
Another yet unhurt, and now a third<span class="lnm">670</span><br />
Dragg'd breathless through the battle by his feet<br />
And all her garb was dappled thick with blood<br />
Like living men they traversed and they strove,<br />
And dragg'd by turns the bodies of the slain.</p>
<p>  He also graved on it a fallow field<span class="lnm">675</span><br />
Rich, spacious, and well-till'd. Plowers not few,<br />
There driving to and fro their sturdy teams,<br />
Labor'd the land; and oft as in their course<br />
They came to the field's bourn, so oft a man<br />
Met them, who in their hands a goblet placed<span class="lnm">680</span><br />
Charged with delicious wine. They, turning, wrought<br />
Each his own furrow, and impatient seem'd<br />
To reach the border of the tilth, which black<br />
Appear'd behind them as a glebe new-turn'd,<br />
Though golden. Sight to be admired by all!<span class="lnm">685</span></p>
<p>  There too he form'd the likeness of a field<br />
Crowded with corn, in which the reapers toil'd<br />
Each with a sharp-tooth'd sickle in his hand.<br />
Along the furrow here, the harvest fell<br />
In frequent handfuls, there, they bound the sheaves.<span class="lnm">690</span><br />
Three binders of the sheaves their sultry task<br />
All plied industrious, and behind them boys<br />
Attended, filling with the corn their arms<br />
And offering still their bundles to be bound.<br />
Amid them, staff in hand, the master stood<span class="lnm">695</span><br />
Silent exulting, while beneath an oak<br />
Apart, his heralds busily prepared<br />
The banquet, dressing a well-thriven ox<br />
New slain, and the attendant maidens mix'd<br />
Large supper for the hinds of whitest flour.<span class="lnm">700</span></p>
<p>  There also, laden with its fruit he form'd<br />
A vineyard all of gold; purple he made<br />
The clusters, and the vines supported stood<br />
By poles of silver set in even rows.<br />
<span class="pgnm">471</span><a name="page_471" id="page_471"></a>
The trench he color'd sable, and around<span class="lnm">705</span><br />
Fenced it with tin. One only path it show'd<br />
By which the gatherers when they stripp'd the vines<br />
Pass'd and repass'd. There, youths and maidens blithe<br />
In frails of wicker bore the luscious fruit,<br />
While, in the midst, a boy on his shrill harp<span class="lnm">710</span><br />
Harmonious play'd, still as he struck the chord<br />
Carolling to it with a slender voice.<br />
They smote the ground together, and with song<br />
And sprightly reed came dancing on behind.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_18-12">[12]</a></p>
<p>  There too a herd he fashion'd of tall beeves<span class="lnm">715</span><br />
Part gold, part tin. They, lowing, from the stalls<br />
Rush'd forth to pasture by a river-side<br />
Rapid, sonorous, fringed with whispering reeds.<br />
Four golden herdsmen drove the kine a-field<br />
By nine swift dogs attended. Dreadful sprang<span class="lnm">720</span><br />
Two lions forth, and of the foremost herd<br />
Seized fast a bull. Him bellowing they dragg'd,<br />
While dogs and peasants all flew to his aid.<br />
The lions tore the hide of the huge prey<br />
And lapp'd his entrails and his blood. Meantime<span class="lnm">725</span><br />
The herdsmen, troubling them in vain, their hounds<br />
Encouraged; but no tooth for lions' flesh<br />
Found they, and therefore stood aside and bark'd.</p>
<p>  There also, the illustrious smith divine<br />
Amidst a pleasant grove a pasture form'd<span class="lnm">730</span><br />
Spacious, and sprinkled o'er with silver sheep<br />
Numerous, and stalls and huts and shepherds' tents.</p>
<p>  To these the glorious artist added next,<br />
With various skill delineated exact,<br />
A labyrinth for the dance, such as of old<span class="lnm">735</span><br />
In Crete's broad island D&aelig;dalus composed<br />
<span class="pgnm">472</span><a name="page_472" id="page_472"></a>
For bright-hair'd Ariadne.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_18-13">[13]</a> There the youths<br />
And youth-alluring maidens, hand in hand,<br />
Danced jocund, every maiden neat-attired<br />
In finest linen, and the youths in vests<span class="lnm">740</span><br />
Well-woven, glossy as the glaze of oil.<br />
These all wore garlands, and bright falchions, those,<br />
Of burnish'd gold in silver trappings hung:&mdash;<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_18-14">[14]</a><br />
They with well-tutor'd step, now nimbly ran<br />
The circle, swift, as when, before his wheel<span class="lnm">745</span><br />
Seated, the potter twirls it with both hands<br />
For trial of its speed,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_18-15">[15]</a> now, crossing quick<br />
They pass'd at once into each other's place.<br />
On either side spectators numerous stood<br />
Delighted, and two tumblers roll'd themselves<span class="lnm">750</span><br />
Between the dancers, singing as they roll'd.</p>
<p>  Last, with the might of ocean's boundless flood<br />
He fill'd the border of the wondrous shield.</p>
<p>  When thus the massy shield magnificent<br />
He had accomplish'd, for the hero next<span class="lnm">755</span><br />
He forged, more ardent than the blaze of fire,<br />
A corselet; then, a ponderous helmet bright<br />
Well fitted to his brows, crested with gold,<br />
And with laborious art divine adorn'd.<br />
He also made him greaves of molten tin.<span class="lnm">760</span></p>
<p>  The armor finish'd, bearing in his hand<br />
The whole, he set it down at Thetis' feet.<br />
She, like a falcon from the snowy top<br />
Stoop'd of Olympus, bearing to the earth<br />
The dazzling wonder, fresh from Vulcan's hand.<span class="lnm">765</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="noind">Now rose the morn in saffron vest attired<br />
From ocean, with new day for Gods and men,<br />
When Thetis at the fleet of Greece arrived,<br />
Bearing that gift divine. She found her son<br />
All tears, and close enfolding in his arms<span class="lnm">5</span><br />
Patroclus, while his Myrmidons around<br />
Wept also;<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_19-1">[1]</a> she amid them, graceful, stood,<br />
And seizing fast his hand, him thus bespake.</p>
<p>  Although our loss be great, yet, oh my son!<br />
Leave we Patroclus lying on the bier<span class="lnm">10</span><br />
To which the Gods ordain'd him from the first.<br />
Receive from Vulcan's hands these glorious arms,<br />
Such as no mortal shoulders ever bore.</p>
<p>  So saying, she placed the armor on the ground<br />
Before him, and the whole bright treasure rang.<span class="lnm">15</span><br />
A tremor shook the Myrmidons; none dared<br />
Look on it, but all fled. Not so himself.<br />
In him fresh vengeance kindled at the view,<br />
And, while he gazed, a splendor as of fire<br />
Flash'd from his eyes. Delighted, in his hand<span class="lnm">20</span><br />
He held the glorious bounty of the God,<br />
And, wondering at those strokes of art divine,<br />
<span class="pgnm">476</span><a name="page_476" id="page_476"></a>
His eager speech thus to his mother turn'd.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_19-2">[2]</a></p>
<p>  The God, my mother! hath bestow'd in truth<br />
Such armor on me as demanded skill<span class="lnm">25</span><br />
Like his, surpassing far all power of man.<br />
Now, therefore, I will arm. But anxious fears<br />
Trouble me, lest intrusive flies, meantime,<br />
Breed worms within the spear-inflicted wounds<br />
Of Men&oelig;tiades, and fill with taint<span class="lnm">30</span><br />
Of putrefaction his whole breathless form.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_19-3">[3]</a></p>
<p>  But him the silver-footed Goddess fair<br />
Thus answer'd. Oh, my son! chase from thy mind<br />
All such concern. I will, myself, essay<br />
To drive the noisome swarms which on the slain<span class="lnm">35</span><br />
In battle feed voracious. Should he lie<br />
The year complete, his flesh shall yet be found<br />
Untainted, and, it may be, fragrant too.<br />
But thou the heroes of Achaia's host<br />
Convening, in their ears thy wrath renounce<span class="lnm">40</span><br />
Against the King of men, then, instant, arm<br />
For battle, and put on thy glorious might.</p>
<p>  So saying, the Goddess raised his courage high.<br />
Then, through the nostrils of the dead she pour'd<br />
Ambrosia, and the ruddy juice divine<span class="lnm">45</span><br />
Of nectar, antidotes against decay.</p>
<p>  And now forth went Achilles by the side<br />
Of ocean, calling with a dreadful shout<br />
To council all the heroes of the host.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_19-4">[4]</a><br />
Then, even they who in the fleet before<span class="lnm">50</span><br />
Constant abode, helmsmen and those who held<br />
In stewardship the food and public stores,<br />
<span class="pgnm">477</span><a name="page_477" id="page_477"></a>
All flock'd to council, for that now at length<br />
After long abstinence from dread exploits<br />
Of war, Achilles had once more appear'd.<span class="lnm">55</span><br />
Two went together, halting on the spear,<br />
(For still they felt the anguish of their wounds)<br />
Noble Ulysses and brave Diomede,<br />
And took an early seat; whom follow'd last<br />
The King of men, by Co&ouml;n in the field<span class="lnm">60</span><br />
Of furious battle wounded with a lance.<br />
The Grecians all assembled, in the midst<br />
Upstood the swift Achilles, and began.</p>
<p>  Atrides! we had doubtless better sped<br />
Both thou and I, thus doing, when at first<span class="lnm">65</span><br />
With cruel rage we burn'd, a girl the cause.<br />
I would that Dian's shaft had in the fleet<br />
Slain her that self-same day when I destroy'd<br />
Lyrnessus, and by conquest made her mine!<br />
Then had not many a Grecian, lifeless now,<span class="lnm">70</span><br />
Clench'd with his teeth the ground, victim, alas!<br />
Of my revenge; whence triumph hath accrued<br />
To Hector and his host, while ours have cause<br />
For long remembrance of our mutual strife.<br />
But evils past let pass, yielding perforce<span class="lnm">75</span><br />
To sad necessity. My wrath shall cease<br />
Now; I resign it; it hath burn'd too long.<br />
Thou therefore summon forth the host to fight,<br />
That I may learn meeting them in the field,<br />
If still the Trojans purpose at our fleet<span class="lnm">80</span><br />
To watch us this night also. But I judge<br />
That driven by my spear to rapid flight,<br />
They shall escape with weary limbs<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_19-5">[5]</a> at least.</p>
<p>  He ended, and the Grecians brazen-greaved<br />
Rejoiced that Peleus' mighty son had cast<span class="lnm">85</span><br />
His wrath aside. Then not into the midst<br />
Proceeding, but at his own seat, upstood<br />
King Agamemnon, and them thus bespake.</p>
<p><span class="pgnm">478</span><a name="page_478" id="page_478"></a>
  Friends! Grecian heroes! Ministers of Mars!<br />
Arise who may to speak, he claims your ear;<span class="lnm">90</span><br />
All interruption wrongs him, and distracts,<br />
Howe'er expert the speaker. Who can hear<br />
Amid the roar of tumult, or who speak?<br />
The clearest voice, best utterance, both are vain<br />
I shall address Achilles. Hear my speech<span class="lnm">95</span><br />
Ye Argives, and with understanding mark.<br />
I hear not now the voice of your reproach<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_19-6">[6]</a><br />
First; ye have oft condemn'd me. Yet the blame<br />
Rests not with me; Jove, Destiny, and she<br />
Who roams the shades, Erynnis, caused the offence.<span class="lnm">100</span><br />
She fill'd my soul with fury on that day<br />
In council, when I seized Achilles' prize.<br />
For what could I? All things obey the Gods.<br />
Ate, pernicious Power, daughter of Jove,<br />
By whom all suffer, challenges from all<span class="lnm">105</span><br />
Reverence and fear. Delicate are her feet<br />
Which scorn the ground, and over human heads<br />
She glides, injurious to the race of man,<br />
Of two who strive, at least entangling one.<br />
She injured, on a day, dread Jove himself<span class="lnm">110</span><br />
Most excellent of all in earth or heaven,<br />
When Juno, although female, him deceived,<br />
What time Alcmena should have brought to light<br />
In bulwark'd Thebes the force of Hercules.<br />
Then Jove, among the gods glorying, spake.<span class="lnm">115</span></p>
<p>  Hear all! both Gods and Goddesses, attend!<br />
That I may make my purpose known. This day<br />
Birth-pang-dispensing Ilithya brings<br />
An hero forth to light, who, sprung from those<br />
That sprang from me, his empire shall extend<span class="lnm">120</span><br />
Over all kingdoms bordering on his own.</p>
<p>  To whom, designing fraud, Juno replied.<br />
Thou wilt be found false, and this word of thine<br />
Shall want performance. But Olympian Jove!<br />
<span class="pgnm">479</span><a name="page_479" id="page_479"></a>
Swear now the inviolable oath, that he<span class="lnm">125</span><br />
Who shall, this day, fall from between the feet<br />
Of woman, drawing his descent from thee,<br />
Shall rule all kingdoms bordering on his own.</p>
<p>  She said, and Jove, suspecting nought her wiles,<br />
The great oath swore, to his own grief and wrong.<span class="lnm">130</span><br />
At once from the Olympian summit flew<br />
Juno, and to Achaian Argos borne,<br />
There sought the noble wife<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_19-7">[7]</a> of Sthenelus,<br />
Offspring of Perseus. Pregnant with a son<br />
Six months, she now the seventh saw at hand,<span class="lnm">135</span><br />
But him the Goddess premature produced,<br />
And check'd Alcmena's pangs already due.<br />
Then joyful to have so prevail'd, she bore<br />
Herself the tidings to Saturnian Jove.</p>
<p>  Lord of the candent lightnings! Sire of all!<span class="lnm">140</span><br />
I bring thee tidings. The great prince, ordain'd<br />
To rule the Argive race, this day is born,<br />
Eurystheus, son of Sthenelus, the son<br />
Of Perseus; therefore he derives from thee,<br />
Nor shall the throne of Argos shame his birth.<span class="lnm">145</span></p>
<p>  She spake; then anguish stung the heart of Jove<br />
Deeply, and seizing by her glossy locks<br />
The Goddess Ate, in his wrath he swore<br />
That never to the starry skies again<br />
And the Olympian heights he would permit<span class="lnm">150</span><br />
The universal mischief to return.<br />
Then, whirling her around, he cast her down<br />
To earth. She, mingling with all works of men,<br />
Caused many a pang to Jove, who saw his son<br />
Laborious tasks servile, and of his birth<span class="lnm">155</span><br />
Unworthy, at Eurystheus' will enjoin'd.</p>
<p>  So when the hero Hector at our ships<br />
Slew us, I then regretted my offence<br />
Which Ate first impell'd me to commit.<br />
But since, infatuated by the Gods<span class="lnm">160</span><br />
I err'd, behold me ready to appease<br />
<span class="pgnm">480</span><a name="page_480" id="page_480"></a>
With gifts of price immense whom I have wrong'd.<br />
Thou, then, arise to battle, and the host<br />
Rouse also. Not a promise yesternight<br />
Was made thee by Ulysses in thy tent<span class="lnm">165</span><br />
On my behalf, but shall be well perform'd.<br />
Or if it please thee, though impatient, wait<br />
Short season, and my train shall bring the gifts<br />
Even now; that thou may'st understand and know<br />
That my peace-offerings are indeed sincere.<span class="lnm">170</span></p>
<p>  To whom Achilles, swiftest of the swift.<br />
Atrides! Agamemnon! passing all<br />
In glory! King of men! recompense just<br />
By gifts to make me, or to make me none,<br />
That rests with thee. But let us to the fight<span class="lnm">175</span><br />
Incontinent. It is no time to play<br />
The game of rhetoric, and to waste the hours<br />
In speeches. Much remains yet unperform'd.<br />
Achilles must go forth. He must be seen<br />
Once more in front of battle, wasting wide<span class="lnm">180</span><br />
With brazen spear, the crowded ranks of Troy.<br />
Mark him&mdash;and as he fights, fight also ye.</p>
<p>  To whom Ulysses ever-wise replied.<br />
Nay&mdash;urge not, valiant as thou art thyself,<br />
Achaia's sons up to the battlements<span class="lnm">185</span><br />
Of Ilium, by repast yet unrefresh'd,<br />
Godlike Achilles!&mdash;For when phalanx once<br />
Shall clash with phalanx, and the Gods with rage<br />
Both hosts inspire, the contest shall not then<br />
Prove short. Bid rather the Achaians take<span class="lnm">190</span><br />
Both food and wine, for they are strength and might.<br />
To stand all day till sunset to a foe<br />
Opposed in battle, fasting, were a task<br />
Might foil the best; for though his will be prompt<br />
To combat, yet the power must by degrees<span class="lnm">195</span><br />
Forsake him; thirst and hunger he must feel,<br />
And his limbs failing him at every step.<br />
But he who hath his vigor to the full<br />
Fed with due nourishment, although he fight<br />
<span class="pgnm">481</span><a name="page_481" id="page_481"></a>
All day, yet feels his courage unimpair'd,<span class="lnm">200</span><br />
Nor weariness perceives till all retire.<br />
Come then&mdash;dismiss the people with command<br />
That each prepare replenishment. Meantime<br />
Let Agamemnon, King of men, his gifts<br />
In presence here of the assembled Greeks<span class="lnm">205</span><br />
Produce, that all may view them, and that thou<br />
May'st feel thine own heart gladden'd at the sight.<br />
Let the King also, standing in the midst,<br />
Swear to thee, that he renders back the maid<br />
A virgin still, and strange to his embrace,<span class="lnm">210</span><br />
And let thy own composure prove, the while,<br />
That thou art satisfied. Last, let him spread<br />
A princely banquet for thee in his tent,<br />
That thou may'st want no part of just amends.<br />
Thou too, Atrides, shalt hereafter prove<span class="lnm">215</span><br />
More just to others; for himself, a King,<br />
Stoops not too low, soothing whom he hath wrong'd.</p>
<p>  Him Agamemnon answer'd, King of men.<br />
Thou hast arranged wisely the whole concern,<br />
O L&auml;ertiades, and I have heard<span class="lnm">220</span><br />
Thy speech, both words and method with delight.<br />
Willing I am, yea more, I wish to swear<br />
As thou hast said, for by the Gods I can<br />
Most truly. Let Achilles, though of pause<br />
Impatient, suffer yet a short delay<span class="lnm">225</span><br />
With all assembled here, till from my tent<br />
The gifts arrive, and oaths of peace be sworn.<br />
To thee I give it in peculiar charge<br />
That choosing forth the most illustrious youths<br />
Of all Achaia, thou produce the gifts<span class="lnm">230</span><br />
from my own ship, all those which yesternight<br />
We promised, nor the women leave behind.<br />
And let Talthybius throughout all the camp<br />
Of the Achaians, instant, seek a boar<br />
For sacrifice to Jove and to the Sun.<span class="lnm">235</span></p>
<p>  Then thus Achilles matchless in the race.<br />
Atrides! most illustrious! King of men!<br />
<span class="pgnm">482</span><a name="page_482" id="page_482"></a>
Expedience bids us to these cares attend<br />
Hereafter, when some pause, perchance, of fight<br />
Shall happen, and the martial rage which fires<span class="lnm">240</span><br />
My bosom now, shall somewhat less be felt.<br />
Our friends by Priameian Hector slain,<br />
Now strew the field mangled, for him hath Jove<br />
Exalted high, and given him great renown.<br />
But haste, now take refreshment; though, in truth<span class="lnm">245</span><br />
Might I direct, the host should by all means<br />
Unfed to battle, and at set of sun<br />
All sup together, this affront revenged.<br />
But as for me, no drop shall pass my lips<br />
Or morsel, whose companion lies with feet<span class="lnm">250</span><br />
Turn'd to the vestibule, pierced by the spear,<br />
And compass'd by my weeping train around.<br />
No want of food feel I. My wishes call<br />
For carnage, blood, and agonies and groans.</p>
<p>  But him, excelling in all wisdom, thus<span class="lnm">255</span><br />
Ulysses answer'd. Oh Achilles! son<br />
Of Peleus! bravest far of all our host!<br />
Me, in no scanty measure, thou excell'st<br />
Wielding the spear, and thee in prudence, I<br />
Not less. For I am elder, and have learn'd<span class="lnm">260</span><br />
What thou hast yet to learn. Bid then thine heart<br />
Endure with patience to be taught by me.<br />
Men, satiate soon with battle, loathe the field<br />
On which the most abundant harvest falls,<br />
Reap'd by the sword; and when the hand of Jove<span class="lnm">265</span><br />
Dispenser of the great events of war,<br />
Turns once the scale, then, farewell every hope<br />
Of more than scanty gleanings. Shall the Greeks<br />
Abstain from sustenance for all who die?<br />
That were indeed severe, since day by day<span class="lnm">270</span><br />
No few expire, and respite could be none.<br />
The dead, die whoso may, should be inhumed.<br />
This, duty bids, but bids us also deem<br />
One day sufficient for our sighs and tears.<br />
Ourselves, all we who still survive the war,<span class="lnm">275</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">483</span><a name="page_483" id="page_483"></a>
Have need of sustenance, that we may bear<br />
The lengthen'd conflict with recruited might,<br />
Case in enduring brass.&mdash;Ye all have heard<br />
Your call to battle; let none lingering stand<br />
In expectation of a farther call,<span class="lnm">280</span><br />
Which if it sound, shall thunder prove to him<br />
Who lurks among the ships. No. Rush we all<br />
Together forth, for contest sharp prepared,<br />
And persevering with the host of Troy.</p>
<p>  So saying, the sons of Nestor, glorious Chief,<span class="lnm">285</span><br />
He chose, with Meges Phyleus' noble son,<br />
Thoas, Meriones, and Melanippus<br />
And Lycomedes. These, together, sought<br />
The tent of Agamemnon, King of men.<br />
They ask'd, and they received. Soon they produced<span class="lnm">290</span><br />
The seven promised tripods from the tent,<br />
Twice ten bright caldrons, twelve high-mettled steeds,<br />
Seven lovely captives skill'd alike in arts<br />
Domestic, of unblemish'd beauty rare,<br />
And last, Bris&euml;is with the blooming cheeks.<span class="lnm">295</span><br />
Before them went Ulysses, bearing weigh'd<br />
Ten golden talents, whom the chosen Greeks<br />
Attended laden with the remnant gifts.<br />
Full in the midst they placed them. Then arose<br />
King Agamemnon, and Talthybius<span class="lnm">300</span><br />
The herald, clear in utterance as a God,<br />
Beside him stood, holding the victim boar.<br />
Atrides, drawing forth his dagger bright,<br />
Appendant ever to his sword's huge sheath,<br />
Sever'd the bristly forelock of the boar,<span class="lnm">305</span><br />
A previous offering. Next, with lifted hands<br />
To Jove he pray'd, while, all around, the Greeks<br />
Sat listening silent to the Sovereign's voice.<br />
He look'd to the wide heaven, and thus he pray'd.</p>
<p>  First, Jove be witness! of all Powers above<span class="lnm">310</span><br />
Best and supreme; Earth next, and next the Sun!<br />
And last, who under Earth the guilt avenge<br />
Of oaths sworn falsely, let the Furies hear!<br />
<span class="pgnm">484</span><a name="page_484" id="page_484"></a>
For no respect of amorous desire<br />
Or other purpose, have I laid mine hand<span class="lnm">315</span><br />
On fair Bris&euml;is, but within my tent<br />
Untouch'd, immaculate she hath remain'd.<br />
And if I falsely swear, then may the Gods<br />
The many woes with which they mark the crime<br />
Of men forsworn, pour also down on me!<span class="lnm">320</span></p>
<p>  So saying, he pierced the victim in his throat<br />
And, whirling him around, Talthybius, next,<br />
Cast him into the ocean, fishes' food.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_19-8">[8]</a><br />
Then, in the centre of Achaia's sons<br />
Uprose Achilles, and thus spake again.<span class="lnm">325</span></p>
<p>  Jove! Father! dire calamities, effects<br />
Of thy appointment, fall on human-kind.<br />
Never had Agamemnon in my breast<br />
Such anger kindled, never had he seized,<br />
Blinded by wrath, and torn my prize away,<span class="lnm">330</span><br />
But that the slaughter of our numerous friends<br />
Which thence ensued, thou hadst, thyself, ordained.<br />
Now go, ye Grecians, eat, and then to battle.</p>
<p>  So saying, Achilles suddenly dissolved<br />
The hasty council, and all flew dispersed<span class="lnm">335</span><br />
To their own ships. Then took the Myrmidons<br />
Those splendid gifts which in the tent they lodged<br />
Of swift Achilles, and the damsels led<br />
Each to a seat, while others of his train<br />
Drove forth the steeds to pasture with his herd.<span class="lnm">340</span><br />
But when Bris&euml;is, bright as Venus, saw<br />
Patroclus lying mangled by the spear,<br />
Enfolding him around, she shriek'd and tore<br />
Her bosom, her smooth neck and beauteous cheeks.<br />
Then thus, divinely fair, with tears she said.<span class="lnm">345</span></p>
<p>  Ah, my Patroclus! dearest friend of all<br />
To hapless me, departing from this tent<br />
I left thee living, and now, generous Chief!<br />
Restored to it again, here find thee dead.<br />
<span class="pgnm">485</span><a name="page_485" id="page_485"></a>
How rapid in succession are my woes!<span class="lnm">350</span><br />
I saw, myself, the valiant prince to whom<br />
My parents had betroth'd me, slain before<br />
Our city walls; and my three brothers, sons<br />
Of my own mother, whom with long regret<br />
I mourn, fell also in that dreadful field.<span class="lnm">355</span><br />
But when the swift Achilles slew the prince<br />
Design'd my spouse, and the fair city sack'd<br />
Of noble Mynes, thou by every art<br />
Of tender friendship didst forbid my tears,<br />
Promising oft that thou would'st make me bride<span class="lnm">360</span><br />
Of Peleus' godlike son, that thy own ship<br />
Should waft me hence to Phthia, and that thyself<br />
Would'st furnish forth among the Myrmidons<br />
Our nuptial feast. Therefore thy death I mourn<br />
Ceaseless, for thou wast ever kind to me.<span class="lnm">365</span></p>
<p>  She spake, and all her fellow-captives heaved<br />
Responsive sighs, deploring each, in show,<br />
The dead Patroclus, but, in truth, herself.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_19-9">[9]</a><br />
Then the Achaian Chiefs gather'd around<br />
Achilles, wooing him to eat, but he<span class="lnm">370</span><br />
Groan'd and still resolute, their suit refused&mdash;</p>
<p>  If I have here a friend on whom by prayers<br />
I may prevail, I pray that ye desist,<br />
Nor longer press me, mourner as I am,<br />
To eat or drink, for till the sun go down<span class="lnm">375</span><br />
I am inflexible, and <i>will</i> abstain.</p>
<p>  So saying, the other princes he dismiss'd<br />
Impatient, but the sons of Atreus both,<br />
Ulysses, Nestor and Idomeneus,<br />
With Ph&oelig;nix, hoary warrior, in his tent<span class="lnm">380</span><br />
Abiding still, with cheerful converse kind<br />
Essay'd to soothe him, whose afflicted soul<br />
All soothing scorn'd till he should once again<br />
<span class="pgnm">486</span><a name="page_486" id="page_486"></a>
Rush on the ravening edge of bloody war.<br />
Then, mindful of his friend, groaning he said<span class="lnm">385</span></p>
<p>  Time was, unhappiest, dearest of my friends!<br />
When even thou, with diligent dispatch,<br />
Thyself, hast spread a table in my tent,<br />
The hour of battle drawing nigh between<br />
The Greeks and warlike Trojans. But there lies<span class="lnm">390</span><br />
Thy body now, gored by the ruthless steel,<br />
And for thy sake I neither eat nor drink,<br />
Though dearth be none, conscious that other wo<br />
Surpassing this I can have none to fear.<br />
No, not if tidings of my father's death<span class="lnm">395</span><br />
Should reach me, who, this moment, weeps, perhaps,<br />
In Phthia tears of tenderest regret<br />
For such a son; while I, remote from home<br />
Fight for detested Helen under Troy.<br />
Nor even were <i>he</i> dead, whom, if he live,<span class="lnm">400</span><br />
I rear in Scyros, my own darling son,<br />
My Neoptolemus of form divine.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_19-10">[10]</a><br />
For still this hope I cherish'd in my breast<br />
Till now, that, of us two, myself alone<br />
Should fall at Ilium, and that thou, restored<span class="lnm">405</span><br />
To Phthia, should'st have wafted o'er the waves<br />
My son from Scyros to his native home,<br />
That thou might'st show him all his heritage,<br />
My train of menials, and my fair abode.<br />
For either dead already I account<span class="lnm">410</span><br />
Peleus, or doubt not that his residue<br />
Of miserable life shall soon be spent,<br />
Through stress of age and expectation sad<br />
That tidings of my death shall, next, arrive.</p>
<p>  So spake Achilles weeping, around whom<span class="lnm">415</span><br />
The Chiefs all sigh'd, each with remembrance pain'd<br />
Of some loved object left at home. Meantime<br />
Jove, with compassion moved, their sorrow saw,<br />
And in wing'd accents thus to Pallas spake.</p>
<p><span class="pgnm">487</span><a name="page_487" id="page_487"></a>
  Daughter! thou hast abandon'd, as it seems,<span class="lnm">420</span><br />
Yon virtuous Chief for ever; shall no care<br />
Thy mind engage of brave Achilles more?<br />
Before his gallant fleet mourning he sits<br />
His friend, disconsolate; the other Greeks<br />
Sat and are satisfied; he only fasts.<span class="lnm">425</span><br />
Go then&mdash;instil nectar into his breast,<br />
And sweets ambrosial, that he hunger not.</p>
<p>  So saying, he urged Minerva prompt before.<br />
In form a shrill-voiced Harpy of long wing<br />
Through ether down she darted, while the Greeks<span class="lnm">430</span><br />
In all their camp for instant battle arm'd.<br />
Ambrosial sweets and nectar she instill'd<br />
Into his breast, lest he should suffer loss<br />
Of strength through abstinence, then soar'd again<br />
To her great Sire's unperishing abode.<span class="lnm">435</span><br />
And now the Grecians from their gallant fleet<br />
All pour'd themselves abroad. As when thick snow<br />
From Jove descends, driven by impetuous gusts<br />
Of the cloud-scattering North, so frequent shone<br />
Issuing from the fleet the dazzling casques,<span class="lnm">440</span><br />
Boss'd bucklers, hauberks strong, and ashen spears.<br />
Upwent the flash to heaven; wide all around<br />
The champain laugh'd with beamy brass illumed,<br />
And tramplings of the warriors on all sides<br />
Resounded, amidst whom Achilles arm'd.<span class="lnm">445</span><br />
He gnash'd his teeth, fire glimmer'd in his eyes,<br />
Anguish intolerable wrung his heart<br />
And fury against Troy, while he put on<br />
His glorious arms, the labor of a God.<br />
First, to his legs his polish'd greaves he clasp'd<span class="lnm">450</span><br />
Studded with silver, then his corselet bright<br />
Braced to his bosom, his huge sword of brass<br />
Athwart his shoulder slung, and his broad shield<br />
Uplifted last, luminous as the moon.<br />
Such as to mariners a fire appears,<span class="lnm">455</span><br />
Kindled by shepherds on the distant top<br />
Of some lone hill; they, driven by stormy winds,<br />
<span class="pgnm">488</span><a name="page_488" id="page_488"></a>
Reluctant roam far off the fishy deep,<br />
Such from Achilles' burning shield divine<br />
A lustre struck the skies; his ponderous helm<span class="lnm">460</span><br />
He lifted to his brows; starlike it shone,<br />
And shook its curling crest of bushy gold,<br />
By Vulcan taught to wave profuse around.<br />
So clad, godlike Achilles trial made<br />
If his arms fitted him, and gave free scope<span class="lnm">465</span><br />
To his proportion'd limbs; buoyant they proved<br />
As wings, and high upbore his airy tread.<br />
He drew his father's spear forth from his case,<br />
Heavy and huge and long. That spear, of all<br />
Achaia's sons, none else had power to wield;<span class="lnm">470</span><br />
Achilles only could the Pelian spear<br />
Brandish, by Chiron for his father hewn<br />
From Pelion's top for slaughter of the brave.<br />
His coursers, then, Automedon prepared<br />
And Alcimus, adjusting diligent<span class="lnm">475</span><br />
The fair caparisons; they thrust the bits<br />
Into their mouths, and to the chariot seat<br />
Extended and made fast the reins behind.<br />
The splendid scourge commodious to the grasp<br />
Seizing, at once Automedon upsprang<span class="lnm">480</span><br />
Into his place; behind him, arm'd complete<br />
Achilles mounted, as the orient sun<br />
All dazzling, and with awful tone his speech<br />
Directed to the coursers of his Sire.</p>
<p>  Xanthus, and Balius of Podarges' blood<span class="lnm">485</span><br />
Illustrious! see ye that, the battle done,<br />
Ye bring whom now ye bear back to the host<br />
Of the Achaians in far other sort,<br />
Nor leave him, as ye left Patroclus, dead.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_19-11">[11]</a><br />
Him then his steed unconquer'd in the race,<span class="lnm">490</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">489</span><a name="page_489" id="page_489"></a>
Xanthus answer'd from beneath his yoke,<br />
But, hanging low his head, and with his mane<br />
Dishevell'd all, and streaming to the ground.<br />
Him Juno vocal made, Goddess white-arm'd.</p>
<p>  And doubtless so we will. This day at least<span class="lnm">495</span><br />
We bear thee safe from battle, stormy Chief!<br />
But thee the hour of thy destruction swift<br />
Approaches, hasten'd by no fault of ours,<br />
But by the force of fate and power divine.<br />
For not through sloth or tardiness on us<span class="lnm">500</span><br />
Aught chargeable, have Ilium's sons thine arms<br />
Stript from Patroclus' shoulders, but a God<br />
Matchless in battle, offspring of bright-hair'd<br />
Latona, him contending in the van<br />
Slew, for the glory of the Chief of Troy.<span class="lnm">505</span><br />
We, Zephyrus himself, though by report<br />
Swiftest of all the winds of heaven, in speed<br />
Could equal, but the Fates thee also doom<br />
By human hands to fall, and hands divine.</p>
<p>  The interposing Furies at that word<span class="lnm">510</span><br />
Suppress'd his utterance,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_19-12">[12]</a> and indignant, thus,<br />
Achilles, swiftest of the swift, replied.</p>
<p>  Why, Xanthus, propheciest thou my death?<br />
It ill beseems thee. I already know<br />
That from my parents far remote my doom<span class="lnm">515</span><br />
Appoints me here to die; yet not the more<br />
Cease I from feats if arms, till Ilium's host<br />
Shall have received, at length, their fill of war.</p>
<p>  He said, and with a shout drove forth to battle.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="noind">The Grecians, thus, before their lofty ships<br />
Stood arm'd around Achilles, glorious Chief<br />
Insatiable with war, and opposite<br />
The Trojans on the rising-ground appear'd.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_20-1">[1]</a><br />
Meantime, Jove order'd Themis, from the head<span class="lnm">5</span><br />
Of the deep-fork'd Olympian to convene<br />
The Gods in council. She to every part<br />
Proceeding, bade them to the courts of Jove.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_20-2">[2]</a><br />
Nor of the Floods was any absent thence<br />
Oceanus except, or of the Nymphs<span class="lnm">10</span><br />
Who haunt the pleasant groves, or dwell beside<br />
Stream-feeding fountains, or in meadows green.<br />
Within the courts of cloud-assembler Jove<br />
Arrived, on pillar'd thrones radiant they sat,<br />
With ingenuity divine contrived<span class="lnm">15</span><br />
By Vulcan for the mighty Sire of all.<br />
Thus they within the Thunderer's palace sat<br />
Assembled; nor was Neptune slow to hear<br />
<span class="pgnm">494</span><a name="page_494" id="page_494"></a>
The voice of Themis, but (the billows left)<br />
Came also; in the midst his seat he took,<span class="lnm">20</span><br />
And ask'd, incontinent, the mind of Jove.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_20-3">[3]</a></p>
<p>  King of the lightnings! wherefore hast thou call'd<br />
The Gods to council? Hast thou aught at heart<br />
Important to the hosts of Greece and Troy?<br />
For on the battle's fiery edge they stand.<span class="lnm">25</span></p>
<p>  To whom replied Jove, Sovereign of the storms,<br />
Thou know'st my council, Shaker of the shores!<br />
And wherefore ye are call'd. Although ordain'd<br />
So soon to die, they interest me still.<br />
Myself, here seated on Olympus' top,<span class="lnm">30</span><br />
With contemplation will my mind indulge<br />
Of yon great spectacle; but ye, the rest,<br />
Descend into the field, Trojan or Greek<br />
Each to assist, as each shall most incline.<br />
For should Achilles in the field no foe<span class="lnm">35</span><br />
Find save the Trojans, quickly should they fly<br />
Before the rapid force of Peleus' son.<br />
They trembled ever at his look, and since<br />
Such fury for his friend hath fired his heart,<br />
I fear lest he anticipate the will<span class="lnm">40</span><br />
Of Fate, and Ilium perish premature.</p>
<p>  So spake the son of Saturn kindling war<br />
Inevitable, and the Gods to fight<br />
'Gan move with minds discordant. Juno sought<br />
And Pallas, with the earth-encircling Power<span class="lnm">45</span><br />
Neptune, the Grecian fleet, with whom were join'd<br />
Mercury, teacher of all useful arts,<br />
And Vulcan, rolling on all sides his eyes<br />
Tremendous, but on disproportion'd legs,<br />
Not without labor hard, halting uncouth.<span class="lnm">50</span><br />
Mars, warrior-God, on Ilium's part appear'd<br />
With Ph&oelig;bus never-shorn, Dian shaft-arm'd,<br />
Xanthus, Latona, and the Queen of smiles,<br />
<span class="pgnm">495</span><a name="page_495" id="page_495"></a>
Venus. So long as the immortal Gods<br />
Mixed not with either host, Achaia's sons<span class="lnm">55</span><br />
Exulted, seeing, after tedious pause,<br />
Achilles in the field, and terror shook<br />
The knees of every Trojan, at the sight<br />
Of swift Achilles like another Mars<br />
Panting for blood, and bright in arms again.<span class="lnm">60</span><br />
But when the Olympian Powers had enter'd once<br />
The multitude, then Discord, at whose voice<br />
The million maddens, vehement arose;<br />
Then, Pallas at the trench without the wall<br />
By turns stood shouting, and by turns a shout<span class="lnm">65</span><br />
Sent terrible along the sounding shore,<br />
While, gloomy as a tempest, opposite,<br />
Mars from the lofty citadel of Troy<br />
Now yell'd aloud, now running o'er the hill<br />
Callicolone, on the Simois' side.<span class="lnm">70</span></p>
<p>  Thus the Immortals, ever-blest, impell'd<br />
Both hosts to battle, and dire inroad caused<br />
Of strife among them. Sudden from on high<br />
The Sire of Gods and men thunder'd; meantime,<br />
Neptune the earth and the high mountains shook;<span class="lnm">75</span><br />
Through all her base and to her topmost peak<br />
Ida spring-fed the agitation felt<br />
Reeling, all Ilium and the fleet of Greece.<br />
Upstarted from his throne, appall'd, the King<br />
Of Erebus, and with a cry his fears<span class="lnm">80</span><br />
Through hell proclaim'd, lest Neptune, o'er his head<br />
Shattering the vaulted earth, should wide disclose<br />
To mortal and immortal eyes his realm<br />
Terrible, squalid, to the Gods themselves<br />
A dreaded spectacle; with such a sound<span class="lnm">85</span><br />
The Powers eternal into battle rush'd.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_20-4">[4]</a><br />
<span class="pgnm">496</span><a name="page_496" id="page_496"></a>
Opposed to Neptune, King of the vast Deep,<br />
Apollo stood with his wing'd arrows arm'd;<br />
Pallas to Mars; Diana shaft-expert,<br />
Sister of Ph&oelig;bus, in her golden bow<span class="lnm">90</span><br />
Rejoicing, with whose shouts the forests ring<br />
To Juno; Mercury, for useful arts<br />
Famed, to Latona; and to Vulcan's force<br />
The eddied River broad by mortal men<br />
Scamander call'd, but Xanthus by the Gods.<span class="lnm">95</span></p>
<p>  So Gods encounter'd Gods. But most desire<br />
Achilles felt, breaking the ranks, to rush<br />
On Priameian Hector, with whose blood<br />
Chiefly his fury prompted him to sate<br />
The indefatigable God of war.<span class="lnm">100</span><br />
But, the encourager of Ilium's host<br />
Apollo, urged &AElig;neas to assail<br />
The son of Peleus, with heroic might<br />
Inspiring his bold heart. He feign'd the voice<br />
Of Priam's son Lycaon, and his form<span class="lnm">105</span><br />
Assuming, thus the Trojan Chief address'd.</p>
<p>  &AElig;neas! Trojan leader! where are now<br />
Thy vaunts, which, banqueting erewhile among<br />
Our princes, o'er thy brimming cups thou mad'st,<br />
That thou would'st fight, thyself, with Peleus' son?<span class="lnm">110</span></p>
<p>  To whom &AElig;neas answer thus returned.<br />
Offspring of Priam! why enjoin'st thou me<br />
Not so inclined, that arduous task, to cope<br />
With the unmatch'd Achilles? I have proved<br />
His force already, when he chased me down<span class="lnm">115</span><br />
From Ida with his spear, what time he made<br />
Seizure of all our cattle, and destroy'd<br />
Pedasus and Lyrnessus; but I 'scaped<br />
Unslain, by Jove himself empower'd to fly,<br />
Else had I fallen by Achilles' hand,<span class="lnm">120</span><br />
And by the hand of Pallas, who his steps<br />
Conducted, and exhorted him to slay<br />
Us and the Leleges.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_20-5">[5]</a> Vain, therefore, proves<br />
<span class="pgnm">497</span><a name="page_497" id="page_497"></a>
All mortal force to Peleus' son opposed;<br />
For one, at least, of the Immortals stands<span class="lnm">125</span><br />
Ever beside him, guardian of his life,<br />
And, of himself, he hath an arm that sends<br />
His rapid spear unerring to the mark.<br />
Yet, would the Gods more equal sway the scales<br />
Of battle, not with ease should he subdue<span class="lnm">130</span><br />
Me, though he boast a panoply of brass.</p>
<p>  Him, then, Apollo answer'd, son of Jove.<br />
Hero! prefer to the immortal Gods<br />
Thy Prayer, for thee men rumor Venus' son<br />
Daughter of Jove; and Peleus' son his birth<span class="lnm">135</span><br />
Drew from a Goddess of inferior note.<br />
Thy mother is from Jove; the offspring, his,<br />
Less noble of the hoary Ocean old.<br />
Go, therefore, and thy conquering spear uplift<br />
Against him, nor let aught his sounding words<span class="lnm">140</span><br />
Appal thee, or his threats turn thee away.</p>
<p>  So saying, with martial force the Chief he fill'd,<br />
Who through the foremost combatants advanced<br />
Radiant in arms. Nor pass'd Anchises' son<br />
Unseen of Juno, through the crowded ranks<span class="lnm">145</span><br />
Seeking Achilles, but the Powers of heaven<br />
Convened by her command, she thus address'd.</p>
<p>  Neptune, and thou, Minerva! with mature<br />
Deliberation, ponder the event.<br />
Yon Chief, &AElig;neas, dazzling bright in arms;<span class="lnm">150</span><br />
Goes to withstand Achilles, and he goes<br />
Sent by Apollo; in despite of whom<br />
Be it our task to give him quick repulse,<br />
Or, of ourselves, let some propitious Power<br />
Strengthen Achilles with a mind exempt<span class="lnm">155</span><br />
From terror, and with force invincible.<br />
So shall he know that of the Gods above<br />
The mightiest are his friends, with whom compared<br />
The favorers of Ilium in time past,<br />
Who stood her guardians in the bloody strife,<span class="lnm">160</span><br />
Are empty boasters all, and nothing worth.<br />
<span class="pgnm">498</span><a name="page_498" id="page_498"></a>
For therefore came we down, that we may share<br />
This fight, and that Achilles suffer nought<br />
Fatal to-day, though suffer all he must<br />
Hereafter, with his thread of life entwined<span class="lnm">165</span><br />
By Destiny, the day when he was born.<br />
But should Achilles unapprized remain<br />
Of such advantage by a voice divine,<br />
When he shall meet some Deity in the field,<br />
Fear then will seize him, for celestial forms<span class="lnm">170</span><br />
Unveil'd are terrible to mortal eyes.</p>
<p>  To whom replied the Shaker of the shores.<br />
Juno! thy hot impatience needs control;<br />
It ill befits thee. No desire I feel<br />
To force into contention with ourselves<span class="lnm">175</span><br />
Gods, our inferiors. No. Let us, retired<br />
To yonder hill, distant from all resort,<br />
There sit, while these the battle wage alone.<br />
But if Apollo, or if Mars the fight<br />
Entering, begin, themselves, to interfere<span class="lnm">180</span><br />
Against Achilles, then will we at once<br />
To battle also; and, I much misdeem,<br />
Or glad they shall be soon to mix again<br />
Among the Gods on the Olympian heights,<br />
By strong coercion of our arms subdued.<span class="lnm">185</span></p>
<p>  So saying, the God of Ocean azure-hair'd<br />
Moved foremost to the lofty mound earth-built<br />
Of noble Hercules, by Pallas raised<br />
And by the Trojans for his safe escape,<br />
What time the monster of the deep pursued<span class="lnm">190</span><br />
The hero from the sea-bank o'er the plain.<br />
There Neptune sat, and his confederate Gods,<br />
Their shoulders with impenetrable clouds<br />
O'ermantled, while the city-spoiler Mars<br />
Sat with Apollo opposite on the hill<span class="lnm">195</span><br />
Callicolone, with their aids divine.<br />
So, Gods to Gods in opposite aspect<br />
Sat ruminating, and alike the work<br />
All fearing to begin of arduous war,<br />
<span class="pgnm">499</span><a name="page_499" id="page_499"></a>
While from his seat sublime Jove urged them on.<span class="lnm">200</span><br />
The champain all was fill'd, and with the blaze<br />
Illumined wide of men and steeds brass-arm'd,<br />
And the incumber'd earth jarr'd under foot<br />
Of the encountering hosts. Then, two, the rest<br />
Surpassing far, into the midst advanced<span class="lnm">205</span><br />
Impatient for the fight, Anchises' son<br />
&AElig;neas and Achilles, glorious Chief!<br />
&AElig;neas first, under his ponderous casque<br />
Nodding and menacing, advanced; before<br />
His breast he held the well-conducted orb<span class="lnm">210</span><br />
Of his broad shield, and shook his brazen spear.<br />
On the other side, Achilles to the fight<br />
Flew like a ravening lion, on whose death<br />
Resolved, the peasants from all quarters meet;<br />
He, viewing with disdain the foremost, stalks<span class="lnm">215</span><br />
Right on, but smitten by some dauntless youth<br />
Writhes himself, and discloses his huge fangs<br />
Hung with white foam; then, growling for revenge,<br />
Lashes himself to battle with his tail,<br />
Till with a burning eye and a bold heart<span class="lnm">220</span><br />
He springs to slaughter, or himself is slain;<br />
So, by his valor and his noble mind<br />
Impell'd, renown'd Achilles moved toward<br />
&AElig;neas, and, small interval between,<br />
Thus spake the hero matchless in the race.<span class="lnm">225</span></p>
<p>  Why stand'st thou here, &AElig;neas! thy own band<br />
Left at such distance? Is it that thine heart<br />
Glows with ambition to contend with me<br />
In hope of Priam's honors, and to fill<br />
His throne hereafter in Troy steed-renown'd?<span class="lnm">230</span><br />
But shouldst thou slay me, not for that exploit<br />
Would Priam such large recompense bestow,<br />
For he hath sons, and hath, beside, a mind<br />
And disposition not so lightly changed.<br />
Or have the Trojans of their richest soil<span class="lnm">235</span><br />
For vineyard apt or plow assign'd thee part<br />
If thou shalt slay me? Difficult, I hope,<br />
<span class="pgnm">500</span><a name="page_500" id="page_500"></a>
At least, thou shalt experience that emprize.<br />
For, as I think, I have already chased<br />
Thee with my spear. Forgettest thou the day<span class="lnm">240</span><br />
When, finding thee alone, I drove thee down<br />
Headlong from Ida, and, thy cattle left<br />
Afar, thou didst not dare in all thy flight<br />
Turn once, till at Lyrnessus safe arrived,<br />
Which city by Jove's aid and by the aid<span class="lnm">245</span><br />
Of Pallas I destroy'd, and captive led<br />
Their women? Thee, indeed, the Gods preserved<br />
But they shall not preserve thee, as thou dream'st<br />
Now also. Back into thy host again;<br />
Hence, I command thee, nor oppose in fight<span class="lnm">250</span><br />
My force, lest evil find thee. To be taught<br />
By suffering only is the part of fools.</p>
<p>  To whom &AElig;neas answer thus return'd.<br />
Pelides! hope not, as I were a boy,<br />
With words to scare me. I have also taunts<span class="lnm">255</span><br />
At my command, and could be sharp as thou.<br />
By such reports as from the lips of men<br />
We oft have heard, each other's birth we know<br />
And parents; but my parents to behold<br />
Was ne'er thy lot, nor have I thine beheld.<span class="lnm">260</span><br />
Thee men proclaim from noble Peleus sprung<br />
And Thetis, bright hair'd Goddess of the Deep;<br />
I boast myself of lovely Venus born<br />
To brave Anchises; and his son this day<br />
In battle slain thy sire shall mourn, or mine;<span class="lnm">265</span><br />
For I expect not that we shall depart<br />
Like children, satisfied with words alone.<br />
But if it please thee more at large to learn<br />
My lineage (thousands can attest it true)<br />
Know this. Jove, Sovereign of the storms, begat<span class="lnm">270</span><br />
Dardanus, and ere yet the sacred walls<br />
Of Ilium rose, the glory of this plain,<br />
He built Dardania; for at Ida's foot<br />
Dwelt our progenitors in ancient days.<br />
Dardanus was the father of a son,<span class="lnm">275</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">501</span><a name="page_501" id="page_501"></a>
King Ericthonius, wealthiest of mankind.<br />
Three thousand mares of his the marish grazed,<br />
Each suckling with delight her tender foal.<br />
Boreas, enamor'd of no few of these,<br />
The pasture sought, and cover'd them in form<span class="lnm">280</span><br />
Of a steed azure-maned. They, pregnant thence,<br />
Twelve foals produced, and all so light of foot,<br />
That when they wanton'd in the fruitful field<br />
They swept, and snapp'd it not, the golden ear;<br />
And when they wanton'd on the boundless deep,<span class="lnm">285</span><br />
They skimm'd the green wave's frothy ridge, secure.<br />
From Ericthonius sprang Tros, King of Troy,<br />
And Tros was father of three famous sons,<br />
Ilus, Assaracus, and Ganymede<br />
Loveliest of human kind, whom for his charms<span class="lnm">290</span><br />
The Gods caught up to heaven, there to abide<br />
With the immortals, cup-bearer of Jove.<br />
Ilus begat Laomedon, and he<br />
Five sons, Tithonus, Priam, Clytius,<br />
Lampus, and Hicetaon, branch of Mars.<span class="lnm">295</span><br />
Assaracus a son begat, by name<br />
Capys, and Capys in due time his son<br />
Warlike Anchises, and Anchises me.<br />
But Priam is the noble Hector's sire.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_20-6">[6]</a><br />
Such is my lineage, and such blood I boast;<span class="lnm">300</span><br />
But valor is from Jove; he, as he wills,<br />
Increases or reduces it in man,<br />
For he is lord of all. Therefore enough&mdash;<br />
Too long like children we have stood, the time<br />
Consuming here, while battle roars around.<span class="lnm">305</span><br />
Reproach is cheap. Easily might we cast<br />
Gibes at each other, till a ship that asks<br />
A hundred oars should sink beneath the load.<br />
The tongue of man is voluble, hath words<br />
For every theme, nor wants wide field and long,<span class="lnm">310</span><br />
And as he speaks so shall he hear again.<br />
<span class="pgnm">502</span><a name="page_502" id="page_502"></a>
But we&mdash;why should we wrangle, and with taunts<br />
Assail each other, as the practice is<br />
Of women, who with heart-devouring strife<br />
On fire, start forth into the public way<span class="lnm">315</span><br />
To mock each other, uttering, as may chance,<br />
Much truth, much falsehood, as their anger bids?<br />
The ardor of my courage will not slack<br />
For all thy speeches; we must combat first;<br />
Now, therefore, without more delay, begin,<span class="lnm">320</span><br />
That we may taste each other's force in arms.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_20-7">[7]</a></p>
<p>  So spake &AElig;neas, and his brazen lance<br />
Hurl'd with full force against the dreadful shield.<br />
Loud roar'd its ample concave at the blow.<br />
Not unalarm'd, Pelides his broad disk<span class="lnm">325</span><br />
Thrust farther from him, deeming that the force<br />
Of such an arm should pierce his guard with ease.<br />
Vain fear! he recollected not that arms<br />
Glorious as his, gifts of the immortal Gods,<br />
Yield not so quickly to the force of man.<span class="lnm">330</span><br />
The stormy spear by brave &AElig;neas sent,<br />
No passage found; the golden plate divine<br />
Repress'd its vehemence; two folds it pierced,<br />
But three were still behind, for with five folds<br />
Vulcan had fortified it; two were brass;<span class="lnm">335</span><br />
The two interior, tin; the midmost, gold;<br />
And at the golden one the weapon stood.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_20-8">[8]</a><br />
<span class="pgnm">503</span><a name="page_503" id="page_503"></a>
Achilles next, hurl'd his long shadow'd spear,<br />
And struck &AElig;neas on the utmost verge<br />
Of his broad shield, where thinnest lay the brass,<span class="lnm">340</span><br />
And thinnest the ox-hide. The Pelian ash<br />
Started right through the buckler, and it rang.<br />
&AElig;neas crouch'd terrified, and his shield<br />
Thrust farther from him; but the rapid beam<br />
Bursting both borders of the ample disk,<span class="lnm">345</span><br />
Glanced o'er his back, and plunged into the soil.<br />
He 'scaped it, and he stood; but, as he stood,<br />
With horror infinite the weapon saw<br />
Planted so near him. Then, Achilles drew<br />
His falchion keen, and with a deafening shout<span class="lnm">350</span><br />
Sprang on him; but &AElig;neas seized a stone<br />
Heavy and huge, a weight to overcharge<br />
Two men (such men as are accounted strong<br />
Now) but he wielded it with ease, alone.<br />
Then had &AElig;neas, as Achilles came<span class="lnm">355</span><br />
Impetuous on, smitten, although in vain,<br />
His helmet or his shield, and Peleus' son<br />
Had with his falchion him stretch'd at his feet,<br />
But that the God of Ocean quick perceived<br />
His peril, and the Immortals thus bespake.<span class="lnm">360</span></p>
<p>  I pity brave &AElig;neas, who shall soon,<br />
Slain by Achilles, see the realms below,<br />
By smooth suggestions of Apollo lured<br />
To danger, such as he can ne'er avert.<br />
But wherefore should the Chief, guiltless himself,<span class="lnm">365</span><br />
Die for the fault of others? at no time<br />
His gifts have fail'd, grateful to all in heaven.<br />
Come, therefore, and let us from death ourselves<br />
Rescue him, lest if by Achilles' arm<br />
This hero perish, Jove himself be wroth;<span class="lnm">370</span><br />
For he is destined to survive, lest all<br />
The house of Dardanus (whom Jove beyond<br />
All others loved, his sons of woman born)<br />
Fail with &AElig;neas, and be found no more.<br />
Saturnian Jove hath hated now long time<span class="lnm">375</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">504</span><a name="page_504" id="page_504"></a>
The family of Priam, and henceforth<br />
&AElig;neas and his son, and his sons' sons,<br />
Shall sway the sceptre o'er the race of Troy.</p>
<p>  To whom, majestic thus the spouse of Jove.<br />
Neptune! deliberate thyself, and choose<span class="lnm">380</span><br />
Whether to save &AElig;neas, or to leave<br />
The hero victim of Achilles' ire.<br />
For Pallas and myself ofttimes have sworn<br />
In full assembly of the Gods, to aid<br />
Troy never, never to avert the day<span class="lnm">385</span><br />
Of her distress, not even when the flames<br />
Kindled by the heroic sons of Greece,<br />
Shall climb with fury to her topmost towers.</p>
<p>  She spake; then Neptune, instant, through the throng<br />
Of battle flying, and the clash of spears,<span class="lnm">390</span><br />
Came where Achilles and &AElig;neas fought.<br />
At once with shadows dim he blurr'd the sight<br />
Of Peleus' son, and from the shield, himself,<br />
Of brave &AElig;neas the bright-pointed ash<br />
Retracting, placed it at Achilles' feet.<span class="lnm">395</span><br />
Then, lifting high &AElig;neas from the ground,<br />
He heaved him far remote; o'er many a rank<br />
Of heroes and of bounding steeds he flew,<br />
Launch'd into air from the expanded palm<br />
Of Neptune, and alighted in the rear<span class="lnm">400</span><br />
Of all the battle where the Caucons stood.<br />
Neptune approach'd him there, and at his side<br />
Standing, in accents wing'd, him thus bespake.</p>
<p>  What God, &AElig;neas! tempted thee to cope<br />
Thus inconsiderately with the son<span class="lnm">405</span><br />
Of Peleus, both more excellent in fight<br />
Than thou, and more the favorite of the skies?<br />
From him retire hereafter, or expect<br />
A premature descent into the shades.<br />
But when Achilles shall have once fulfill'd<span class="lnm">410</span><br />
His destiny, in battle slain, then fight<br />
Fearless, for thou canst fall by none beside.</p>
<p>  So saying, he left the well-admonish'd Chief,<br />
<span class="pgnm">505</span><a name="page_505" id="page_505"></a>
And from Achilles' eyes scatter'd the gloom<br />
Shed o'er them by himself. The hero saw<span class="lnm">415</span><br />
Clearly, and with his noble heart incensed<br />
By disappointment, thus conferring, said.</p>
<p>  Gods! I behold a prodigy. My spear<br />
Lies at my foot, and he at whom I cast<br />
The weapon with such deadly force, is gone!<span class="lnm">420</span><br />
&AElig;neas therefore, as it seems, himself<br />
Interests the immortal Gods, although<br />
I deem'd his boast of their protection vain.<br />
I reck not. Let him go. So gladly 'scaped<br />
From slaughter now, he shall not soon again<span class="lnm">425</span><br />
Feel an ambition to contend with me.<br />
Now will I rouse the Dana&iuml;, and prove<br />
The force in fight of many a Trojan more.</p>
<p>  He said, and sprang to battle with loud voice,<br />
Calling the Grecians after him.&mdash;Ye sons<span class="lnm">430</span><br />
Of the Achaians! stand not now aloof,<br />
My noble friends! but foot to foot let each<br />
Fall on courageous, and desire the fight.<br />
The task were difficult for me alone,<br />
Brave as I boast myself, to chase a foe<span class="lnm">435</span><br />
So numerous, and to combat with them all.<br />
Not Mars himself, immortal though he be,<br />
Nor Pallas, could with all the ranks contend<br />
Of this vast multitude, and drive the whole.<br />
With hands, with feet, with spirit and with might,<span class="lnm">440</span><br />
All that I can I will; right through I go,<br />
And not a Trojan who shall chance within<br />
Spear's reach of me, shall, as I judge, rejoice.</p>
<p>  Thus he the Greeks exhorted. Opposite,<br />
Meantime, illustrious Hector to his host<span class="lnm">445</span><br />
Vociferated, his design to oppose<br />
Achilles publishing in every ear.</p>
<p>  Fear not, ye valiant men of Troy! fear not<br />
The son of Peleus. In a war of words<br />
I could, myself, cope even with the Gods;<span class="lnm">450</span><br />
But not with spears; there they excel us all.<br />
<span class="pgnm">506</span><a name="page_506" id="page_506"></a>
Nor shall Achilles full performance give<br />
To all his vaunts, but, if he some fulfil,<br />
Shall others leave mutilate in the midst.<br />
I will encounter him, though his hands be fire,<span class="lnm">455</span><br />
Though fire his hands, and his heart hammer'd steel.</p>
<p>  So spake he them exhorting. At his word<br />
Uprose the Trojan spears, thick intermixt<br />
The battle join'd, and clamor loud began.<br />
Then thus, approaching Hector, Ph&oelig;bus spake.<span class="lnm">460</span></p>
<p>  Henceforth, advance not Hector! in the front<br />
Seeking Achilles, but retired within<br />
The stormy multitude his coming wait,<br />
Lest his spear reach thee, or his glittering sword.</p>
<p>  He said, and Hector far into his host<span class="lnm">465</span><br />
Withdrew, admonish'd by the voice divine.<br />
Then, shouting terrible, and clothed with might,<br />
Achilles sprang to battle. First, he slew<br />
The valiant Chief Iphition, whom a band<br />
Numerous obey'd. Otrynteus was his sire.<span class="lnm">470</span><br />
Him to Otrynteus, city-waster Chief,<br />
A Naiad under snowy Tmolus bore<br />
In fruitful Hyda.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_20-9">[9]</a> Right into his front<br />
As he advanced, Achilles drove his spear,<br />
And rived his skull; with thundering sound he fell,<span class="lnm">475</span><br />
And thus the conqueror gloried in his fall.</p>
<p>  Ah Otryntides! thou art slain. Here lies<br />
The terrible in arms, who born beside<br />
The broad Gyg&aelig;an lake, where Hyllus flows<br />
And Hermus, call'd the fertile soil his own.<span class="lnm">480</span></p>
<p>  Thus gloried he. Meantime the shades of death<br />
Cover'd Iphition, and Achaian wheels<br />
And horses ground his body in the van.<br />
Demoleon next, Antenor's son, a brave<br />
Defender of the walls of Troy, he slew.<span class="lnm">485</span><br />
Into his temples through his brazen casque<br />
He thrust the Pelian ash, nor could the brass<br />
<span class="pgnm">507</span><a name="page_507" id="page_507"></a>
Such force resist, but the huge weapon drove<br />
The shatter'd bone into his inmost brain,<br />
And his fierce onset at a stroke repress'd.<span class="lnm">490</span><br />
Hippodamas his weapon next received<br />
Within his spine, while with a leap he left<br />
His steeds and fled. He, panting forth his life,<br />
Moan'd like a bull, by consecrated youths<br />
Dragg'd round the Heliconian King,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_20-10">[10]</a> who views<span class="lnm">495</span><br />
That victim with delight. So, with loud moans<br />
The noble warrior sigh'd his soul away.<br />
Then, spear in hand, against the godlike son<br />
Of Priam, Polydorus, he advanced.<br />
Not yet his father had to him indulged<span class="lnm">500</span><br />
A warrior's place, for that of all his sons<br />
He was the youngest-born, his hoary sire's<br />
Chief darling, and in speed surpass'd them all.<br />
Then also, in the vanity of youth,<br />
For show of nimbleness, he started oft<span class="lnm">505</span><br />
Into the vanward, till at last he fell.<br />
Him gliding swiftly by, swifter than he<br />
Achilles with a javelin reach'd; he struck<br />
His belt behind him, where the golden clasps<br />
Met, and the double hauberk interposed.<span class="lnm">510</span><br />
The point transpierced his bowels, and sprang through<br />
His navel; screaming, on his knees he fell,<br />
Death-shadows dimm'd his eyes, and with both hands,<br />
Stooping, he press'd his gather'd bowels back.<br />
But noble Hector, soon as he beheld<span class="lnm">515</span><br />
His brother Polydorus to the earth<br />
Inclined, and with his bowels in his hands,<br />
Sightless well-nigh with anguish could endure<br />
No longer to remain aloof; flame-like<br />
He burst abroad,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_20-11">[11]</a> and shaking his sharp spear,<span class="lnm">520</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">508</span><a name="page_508" id="page_508"></a>
Advanced to meet Achilles, whose approach<br />
Seeing, Achilles bounded with delight,<br />
And thus, exulting, to himself he said.</p>
<p>  Ah! he approaches, who hath stung my soul<br />
Deepest, the slayer of whom most I loved!<span class="lnm">525</span><br />
Behold, we meet! Caution is at an end,<br />
And timid skulking in the walks of war.</p>
<p>  He ceased, and with a brow knit into frowns,<br />
Call'd to illustrious Hector. Haste, approach,<br />
That I may quick dispatch thee to the shades.<span class="lnm">530</span></p>
<p>  Whom answer'd warlike Hector, nought appall'd.<br />
Pelides! hope not, as I were a boy,<br />
With words to scare me. I have also taunts<br />
At my command, and can be sharp as thou.<br />
I know thee valiant, and myself I know<span class="lnm">535</span><br />
Inferior far; yet, whether thou shalt slay<br />
Me, or, inferior as I am, be slain<br />
By me, is at the pleasure of the Gods,<br />
For I wield also not a pointless beam.</p>
<p>  He said, and, brandishing it, hurl'd his spear,<span class="lnm">540</span><br />
Which Pallas, breathing softly, wafted back<br />
From the renown'd Achilles, and it fell<br />
Successless at illustrious Hector's feet.<br />
Then, all on fire to slay him, with a shout<br />
That rent the air Achilles rapid flew<span class="lnm">545</span><br />
Toward him; but him wrapt in clouds opaque<br />
Apollo caught with ease divine away.<br />
Thrice, swift Achilles sprang to the assault<br />
Impetuous, thrice the pitchy cloud he smote,<br />
And at his fourth assault, godlike in act,<span class="lnm">550</span><br />
And terrible in utterance, thus exclaim'd.</p>
<p>  Dog! thou art safe, and hast escaped again;<br />
But narrowly, and by the aid once more<br />
Of Ph&oelig;bus, without previous suit to whom<br />
Thou venturest never where the javelin sings.<span class="lnm">555</span><br />
But when we next encounter, then expect,<br />
<span class="pgnm">509</span><a name="page_509" id="page_509"></a>
If one of all in heaven aid also me,<br />
To close thy proud career. Meantime I seek<br />
Some other, and assail e'en whom I may.</p>
<p>  So saying, he pierced the neck of Dryops through,<span class="lnm">560</span><br />
And at his feet he fell. Him there he left,<br />
And turning on a valiant warrior huge,<br />
Philetor's son, Demuchus, in the knee<br />
Pierced, and detain'd him by the planted spear,<br />
Till with his sword he smote him, and he died.<span class="lnm">565</span><br />
Laogonus and Dardanus he next<br />
Assaulted, sons of Bias; to the ground<br />
Dismounting both, one with his spear he slew,<br />
The other with his falchion at a blow.<br />
Tros too, Alastor's son&mdash;he suppliant clasp'd<span class="lnm">570</span><br />
Achilles' knees, and for his pity sued,<br />
Pleading equality of years, in hope<br />
That he would spare, and send him thence alive.<br />
Ah dreamer! ignorant how much in vain<br />
That suit he urged; for not of milky mind,<span class="lnm">575</span><br />
Or placable in temper was the Chief<br />
To whom he sued, but fiery. With both hands<br />
His knees he clasp'd importunate, and he<br />
Fast by the liver gash'd him with his sword.<br />
His liver falling forth, with sable blood<span class="lnm">580</span><br />
His bosom fill'd, and darkness veil'd his eyes.<br />
Then, drawing close to Mulius, in his ear<br />
He set the pointed brass, and at a thrust<br />
Sent it, next moment, through his ear beyond.<br />
Then, through the forehead of Agenor's son<span class="lnm">585</span><br />
Echechlus, his huge-hafted blade he drove,<br />
And death and fate forever veil'd his eyes.<br />
Next, where the tendons of the elbow meet,<br />
Striking Deucalion, through his wrist he urged<br />
The brazen point; he all defenceless stood,<span class="lnm">590</span><br />
Expecting death; down came Achilles' blade<br />
Full on his neck; away went head and casque<br />
Together; from his spine the marrow sprang,<br />
And at his length outstretch'd he press'd the plain.<br />
<span class="pgnm">510</span><a name="page_510" id="page_510"></a>
From him to Rhigmus, Pireus' noble son,<span class="lnm">595</span><br />
He flew, a warrior from the fields of Thrace.<br />
Him through the loins he pierced, and with the beam<br />
Fixt in his bowels, to the earth he fell;<br />
Then piercing, as he turn'd to flight, the spine<br />
Of Areith&ouml;us his charioteer,<span class="lnm">600</span><br />
He thrust him from his seat; wild with dismay<br />
Back flew the fiery coursers at his fall.<br />
As a devouring fire within the glens<br />
Of some dry mountain ravages the trees,<br />
While, blown around, the flames roll to all sides,<span class="lnm">605</span><br />
So, on all sides, terrible as a God,<br />
Achilles drove the death-devoted host<br />
Of Ilium, and the champain ran with blood.<br />
As when the peasant his yoked steers employs<br />
To tread his barley, the broad-fronted pair<span class="lnm">610</span><br />
With ponderous hoofs trample it out with ease,<br />
So, by magnanimous Achilles driven,<br />
His coursers solid-hoof'd stamp'd as they ran<br />
The shields, at once, and bodies of the slain;<br />
Blood spatter'd all his axle, and with blood<span class="lnm">615</span><br />
From the horse-hoofs and from the fellied wheels<br />
His chariot redden'd, while himself, athirst<br />
For glory, his unconquerable hands<br />
Defiled with mingled carnage, sweat, and dust.</p>

<p class="outd">Achilles having separated the Trojans, and driven one part of them to the
city and the other into the Scamander, takes twelve young men alive, his
intended victims to the manes of Patroclus. The river overflowing his
banks with purpose to overwhelm him, is opposed by Vulcan, and gladly
relinquishes the attempt. The battle of the gods ensues. Apollo, in the
form of Agenor, decoys Achilles from the town, which in the mean time
the Trojans enter and shut the gates against him.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="noind"><a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_21-1">[1]</a>But when they came, at length, where Xanthus winds<br />
His stream vortiginous from Jove derived,<br />
There, separating Ilium's host, he drove<br />
Part o'er the plain to Troy in the same road<br />
By which the Grecians had so lately fled<span class="lnm">5</span><br />
The fury of illustrious Hector's arm.<br />
That way they fled pouring themselves along<br />
Flood-like, and Juno, to retard them, threw<br />
Darkness as night before them. Other part,<br />
Push'd down the sides of Xanthus, headlong plunged<span class="lnm">10</span><br />
With dashing sound into his dizzy stream,<br />
And all his banks re-echoed loud the roar.<br />
They, struggling, shriek'd in silver eddies whirl'd.<br />
As when, by violence of fire expell'd,<br />
Locusts uplifted on the wing escape<span class="lnm">15</span><br />
To some broad river, swift the sudden blaze<br />
Pursues them, they, astonish'd, strew the flood,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_21-2">[2]</a><br />
<span class="pgnm">514</span><a name="page_514" id="page_514"></a>
So, by Achilles driven, a mingled throng<br />
Of horses and of warriors overspread<br />
Xanthus, and glutted all his sounding course<span class="lnm">20</span><br />
He, chief of heroes, leaving on the bank<br />
His spear against a tamarisk reclined,<br />
Plunged like a God, with falchion arm'd alone<br />
But fill'd with thoughts of havoc. On all sides<br />
Down came his edge; groans follow'd dread to hear<span class="lnm">25</span><br />
Of warriors smitten by the sword, and all<br />
The waters as they ran redden'd with blood.<br />
As smaller fishes, flying the pursuit<br />
Of some huge dolphin, terrified, the creeks<br />
And secret hollows of a haven fill,<span class="lnm">30</span><br />
For none of all that he can seize he spares,<br />
So lurk'd the trembling Trojans in the caves<br />
Of Xanthus' awful flood. But he (his hands<br />
Wearied at length with slaughter) from the rest<br />
Twelve youths selected whom to death he doom'd,<span class="lnm">35</span><br />
In vengeance for his loved Patroclus slain.<br />
Them stupified with dread like fawns he drove<br />
Forth from the river, manacling their hands<br />
Behind them fast with their own tunic-strings,<br />
And gave them to his warrior train in charge.<span class="lnm">40</span><br />
Then, ardent still for blood, rushing again<br />
Toward the stream, Dardanian Priam's son<br />
He met, Lycaon, as he climb'd the bank.<br />
Him erst by night, in his own father's field<br />
Finding him, he had led captive away.<span class="lnm">45</span><br />
Lycaon was employ'd cutting green shoots<br />
Of the wild-fig for chariot-rings, when lo!<br />
Terrible, unforeseen, Achilles came.<br />
He seized and sent him in a ship afar<br />
To Lemnos; there the son of Jason paid<span class="lnm">50</span><br />
His price, and, at great cost, E&euml;tion<br />
The guest of Jason, thence redeeming him,<br />
<span class="pgnm">515</span><a name="page_515" id="page_515"></a>
Sent him to fair Arisba;<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_21-3">[3]</a> but he 'scaped<br />
Thence also and regain'd his father's house.<br />
Eleven days, at his return, he gave<span class="lnm">55</span><br />
To recreation joyous with his friends,<br />
And on the twelfth his fate cast him again<br />
Into Achilles' hands, who to the shades<br />
Now doom'd him, howsoever loth to go.<br />
Soon as Achilles swiftest of the swift<span class="lnm">60</span><br />
Him naked saw (for neither spear had he<br />
Nor shield nor helmet, but, when he emerged,<br />
Weary and faint had cast them all away)<br />
Indignant to his mighty self he said.</p>
<p>  Gods! I behold a miracle! Ere long<span class="lnm">65</span><br />
The valiant Trojans whom my self have slain<br />
Shall rise from Erebus, for he is here,<br />
The self-same warrior whom I lately sold<br />
At Lemnos, free, and in the field again.<br />
The hoary deep is prison strong enough<span class="lnm">70</span><br />
For most, but not for him. Now shall he taste<br />
The point of this my spear, that I may learn<br />
By sure experience, whether hell itself<br />
That holds the strongest fast, can him detain,<br />
Or whether he shall thence also escape.<span class="lnm">75</span></p>
<p>  While musing thus he stood, stunn'd with dismay<br />
The youth approach'd, eager to clasp his knees,<br />
For vehement he felt the dread of death<br />
Working within him; with his Pelian ash<br />
Uplifted high noble Achilles stood<span class="lnm">80</span><br />
Ardent to smite him; he with body bent<br />
Ran under it, and to his knees adhered;<br />
The weapon, missing him, implanted stood<br />
Close at his back, when, seizing with one hand<br />
Achilles' knees, he with the other grasp'd<span class="lnm">85</span><br />
The dreadful beam, resolute through despair,<br />
And in wing'd accents suppliant thus began.</p>
<p>  Oh spare me! pity me! Behold I clasp<br />
<span class="pgnm">516</span><a name="page_516" id="page_516"></a>
Thy knees, Achilles! Ah, illustrious Chief!<br />
Reject not with disdain a suppliant's prayer.<span class="lnm">90</span><br />
I am thy guest also, who at thy own board<br />
Have eaten bread, and did partake the gift<br />
Of Ceres with thee on the very day<br />
When thou didst send me in yon field surprised<br />
For sale to sacred Lemnos, far remote,<span class="lnm">95</span><br />
And for my price receiv'dst a hundred beeves.<br />
Loose me, and I will yield thee now that sum<br />
Thrice told. Alas! this morn is but the twelfth<br />
Since, after numerous hardships, I arrived<br />
Once more in Troy, and now my ruthless lot<span class="lnm">100</span><br />
Hath given me into thy hands again.<br />
Jove cannot less than hate me, who hath twice<br />
Made me thy prisoner, and my doom was death,<br />
Death in my prime, the day when I was born<br />
Son of Laoth&ouml;e from Alta sprung,<span class="lnm">105</span><br />
From Alta, whom the Leleges obey<br />
On Satnio's banks in lofty Pedasus.<br />
His daughter to his other numerous wives<br />
King Priam added, and two sons she bore<br />
Only to be deprived by thee of both.<span class="lnm">110</span><br />
My brother hath already died, in front<br />
Of Ilium's infantry, by thy bright spear,<br />
The godlike Polydorus; and like doom<br />
Shall now be mine, for I despair to escape<br />
Thine hands, to which the Gods yield me again.<span class="lnm">115</span><br />
But hear and mark me well. My birth was not<br />
From the same womb as Hector's, who hath slain<br />
Thy valiant friend for clemency renown'd.</p>
<p>  Such supplication the illustrious son<br />
Of Priam made, but answer harsh received.<span class="lnm">120</span></p>
<p>  Fool! speak'st of ransom? Name it not to me.<br />
For till my friend his miserable fate<br />
Accomplish'd, I was somewhat given to spare,<br />
And numerous, whom I seized alive, I sold.<br />
But now, of all the Trojans whom the Gods<span class="lnm">125</span><br />
Deliver to me, none shall death escape,<br />
<span class="pgnm">517</span><a name="page_517" id="page_517"></a>
'Specially of the house of Priam, none.<br />
Die therefore, even thou, my friend! What mean<br />
Thy tears unreasonably shed and vain?<br />
Died not Patroclus. braver far than thou?<span class="lnm">130</span><br />
And look on me&mdash;see'st not to what a height<br />
My stature towers, and what a bulk I boast?<br />
A King begat me, and a Goddess bore.<br />
What then! A death by violence awaits<br />
Me also, and at morn, or eve, or noon,<span class="lnm">135</span><br />
I perish, whensoe'er the destined spear<br />
Shall reach me, or the arrow from the nerve.</p>
<p>  He ceased, and where the suppliant kneel'd, he died.<br />
Quitting the spear, with both hands spread abroad<br />
He sat, but swift Achilles with his sword<span class="lnm">140</span><br />
'Twixt neck and key-bone smote him, and his blade<br />
Of double edge sank all into the wound.<br />
He prone extended on the champain lay<br />
Bedewing with his sable blood the glebe,<br />
Till, by the foot, Achilles cast him far<span class="lnm">145</span><br />
Into the stream, and, as he floated down,<br />
Thus in wing'd accents, glorying, exclaim'd.</p>
<p>  Lie there, and feed the fishes, which shall lick<br />
Thy blood secure. Thy mother ne'er shall place<br />
Thee on thy bier, nor on thy body weep,<span class="lnm">150</span><br />
But swift Scamander on his giddy tide<br />
Shall bear thee to the bosom of the sea.<br />
There, many a fish shall through the crystal flood<br />
Ascending to the rippled surface, find<br />
Lycaon's pamper'd flesh delicious fare.<span class="lnm">155</span><br />
Die Trojans! till we reach your city, you<br />
Fleeing, and slaughtering, I. This pleasant stream<br />
Of dimpling silver which ye worship oft<br />
With victim bulls, and sate with living steeds<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_21-4">[4]</a><br />
His rapid whirlpools, shall avail you nought,<span class="lnm">160</span><br />
But ye shall die, die terribly, till all<br />
Shall have requited me with just amends<br />
<span class="pgnm">518</span><a name="page_518" id="page_518"></a>
For my Patroclus, and for other Greeks<br />
Slain at the ships while I declined the war.</p>
<p>  He ended, at those words still more incensed<span class="lnm">165</span><br />
Scamander means devised, thenceforth to check<br />
Achilles, and avert the doom of Troy.<br />
Meantime the son of Peleus, his huge spear<br />
Grasping, assail'd Asterop&aelig;us son<br />
Of Pelegon, on fire to take his life.<span class="lnm">170</span><br />
Fair Perib&oelig;a, daughter eldest-born<br />
Of Acessamenus, his father bore<br />
To broad-stream'd Axius, who had clasp'd the nymph<br />
In his embrace. On him Achilles sprang.<br />
He newly risen from the river, stood<span class="lnm">175</span><br />
Arm'd with two lances opposite, for him<br />
Xanthus embolden'd, at the deaths incensed<br />
Of many a youth, whom, mercy none vouchsafed,<br />
Achilles had in all his current slain.<br />
And now small distance interposed, they faced<span class="lnm">180</span><br />
Each other, when Achilles thus began.</p>
<p>  Who art and whence, who dar'st encounter me?<br />
Hapless the sires whose sons my force defy.</p>
<p>  To whom the noble son of Pelegon.<br />
Pelides, mighty Chief? Why hast thou ask'd<span class="lnm">185</span><br />
My derivation? From the land I come<br />
Of mellow-soil'd P&oelig;onia far remote,<br />
Chief leader of P&oelig;nia's host spear-arm'd;<br />
This day hath also the eleventh risen<br />
Since I at Troy arrived. For my descent,<span class="lnm">190</span><br />
It is from Axius river wide-diffused,<br />
From Axius, fairest stream that waters earth,<br />
Sire of bold Pelegon whom men report<br />
My sire. Let this suffice. Now fight, Achilles!</p>
<p>  So spake he threatening, and Achilles raised<span class="lnm">195</span><br />
Dauntless the Pelian ash. At once two spears<br />
The hero bold, Asterop&aelig;us threw,<br />
With both hands apt for battle. One his shield<br />
Struck but pierced not, impeded by the gold,<br />
Gift of a God; the other as it flew<span class="lnm">200</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">519</span><a name="page_519" id="page_519"></a>
Grazed at his right elbow; sprang the sable blood;<br />
But, overflying him, the spear in earth<br />
Stood planted deep, still hungering for the prey.<br />
Then, full at the P&oelig;onian Peleus' son<br />
Hurl'd forth his weapon with unsparing force<span class="lnm">205</span><br />
But vain; he struck the sloping river bank,<br />
And mid-length deep stood plunged the ashen beam.<br />
Then, with his falchion drawn, Achilles flew<br />
To smite him; he in vain, meantime, essay'd<br />
To pluck the rooted spear forth from the bank;<span class="lnm">210</span><br />
Thrice with full force he shook the beam, and thrice,<br />
Although reluctant, left it; at his fourth<br />
Last effort, bending it he sought to break<br />
The ashen spear-beam of &AElig;acides,<br />
But perish'd by his keen-edged falchion first;<span class="lnm">215</span><br />
For on the belly at his navel's side<br />
He smote him; to the ground effused fell all<br />
His bowels, death's dim shadows veil'd his eyes.<br />
Achilles ardent on his bosom fix'd<br />
His foot, despoil'd him, and exulting cried.<span class="lnm">220</span></p>
<p>  Lie there; though River-sprung, thou find'st it hard<br />
To cope with sons of Jove omnipotent.<br />
Thou said'st, a mighty River is my sire&mdash;<br />
But my descent from mightier Jove I boast;<br />
My father, whom the Myrmidons obey,<span class="lnm">225</span><br />
Is son of &AElig;acus, and he of Jove.<br />
As Jove all streams excels that seek the sea,<br />
So, Jove's descendants nobler are than theirs.<br />
Behold a River at thy side&mdash;let him<br />
Afford thee, if he can, some succor&mdash;No&mdash;<span class="lnm">230</span><br />
He may not fight against Saturnian Jove.<br />
Therefore, not kingly Achelo&iuml;us,<br />
Nor yet the strength of Ocean's vast profound,<br />
Although from him all rivers and all seas,<br />
All fountains and all wells proceed, may boast<span class="lnm">235</span><br />
Comparison with Jove, but even he<br />
Astonish'd trembles at his fiery bolt,<br />
And his dread thunders rattling in the sky.<br />
<span class="pgnm">520</span><a name="page_520" id="page_520"></a>
He said, and drawing from the bank his spear<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_21-5">[5]</a><br />
Asterop&aelig;us left stretch'd on the sands,<span class="lnm">240</span><br />
Where, while the clear wave dash'd him, eels his flanks<br />
And ravening fishes numerous nibbled bare.<br />
The horsed P&oelig;onians next he fierce assail'd,<br />
Who seeing their brave Chief slain by the sword<br />
And forceful arm of Peleus' son, beside<span class="lnm">245</span><br />
The eddy-whirling stream fled all dispersed.<br />
Thersilochus and Mydon then he slew,<br />
Thrasius, Astypylus and Ophelestes,<br />
&AElig;nius and Mnesus; nor had these sufficed<br />
Achilles, but P&oelig;onians more had fallen,<span class="lnm">250</span><br />
Had not the angry River from within<br />
His circling gulfs in semblance, of a man<br />
Call'd to him, interrupting thus his rage.</p>
<p>  Oh both in courage and injurious deeds<br />
Unmatch'd, Achilles! whom themselves the Gods<span class="lnm">255</span><br />
Cease not to aid, if Saturn's son have doom'd<br />
All Ilium's race to perish by thine arm,<br />
Expel them, first, from me, ere thou achieve<br />
That dread exploit; for, cumber'd as I am<br />
With bodies, I can pour my pleasant stream<span class="lnm">260</span><br />
No longer down into the sacred deep;<br />
All vanish where thou comest. But oh desist<br />
Dread Chief! Amazement fills me at thy deeds.</p>
<p>  To whom Achilles, matchless in the race.<br />
River divine! hereafter be it so.<span class="lnm">265</span><br />
But not from slaughter of this faithless host<br />
I cease, till I shall shut them fast in Troy<br />
And trial make of Hector, if his arm<br />
In single fight shall strongest prove, or mine</p>
<p>  He said, and like a God, furious, again<span class="lnm">270</span><br />
Assail'd the Trojans; then the circling flood<br />
To Ph&oelig;bus thus his loud complaint address'd.</p>
<p>  Ah son of Jove, God of the silver bow!<br />
<span class="pgnm">521</span><a name="page_521" id="page_521"></a>
The mandate of the son of Saturn ill<br />
Hast thou perform'd, who, earnest, bade thee aid<span class="lnm">275</span><br />
The Trojans, till (the sun sunk in the West)<br />
Night's shadow dim should veil the fruitful field.</p>
<p>  He ended, and Achilles spear-renown'd<br />
Plunged from the bank into the middle stream.<br />
Then, turbulent, the River all his tide<span class="lnm">280</span><br />
Stirr'd from the bottom, landward heaving off<br />
The numerous bodies that his current chok'd<br />
Slain by Achilles; them, as with the roar<br />
Of bulls, he cast aground, but deep within<br />
His oozy gulfs the living safe conceal'd.<span class="lnm">285</span><br />
Terrible all around Achilles stood<br />
The curling wave, then, falling on his shield<br />
Dash'd him, nor found his footsteps where to rest.<br />
An elm of massy trunk he seized and branch<br />
Luxuriant, but it fell torn from the root<span class="lnm">290</span><br />
And drew the whole bank after it; immersed<br />
It damm'd the current with its ample boughs,<br />
And join'd as with a bridge the distant shores,<br />
Upsprang Achilles from the gulf and turn'd<br />
His feet, now wing'd for flight, into the plain<span class="lnm">295</span><br />
Astonish'd; but the God, not so appeased,<br />
Arose against him with a darker curl,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_21-6">[6]</a><br />
That he might quell him and deliver Troy.<br />
Back flew Achilles with a bound, the length<br />
Of a spear's cast, for such a spring he own'd<span class="lnm">300</span><br />
As bears the black-plumed eagle on her prey<br />
Strongest and swiftest of the fowls of air.<br />
Like her he sprang, and dreadful on his chest<br />
Clang'd his bright armor. Then, with course oblique<br />
He fled his fierce pursuer, but the flood,<span class="lnm">305</span><br />
Fly where he might, came thundering in his rear.<br />
As when the peasant with his spade a rill<br />
Conducts from some pure fountain through his grove<br />
Or garden, clearing the obstructed course,<br />
<span class="pgnm">522</span><a name="page_522" id="page_522"></a>
The pebbles, as it runs, all ring beneath,<span class="lnm">310</span><br />
And, as the slope still deepens, swifter still<br />
It runs, and, murmuring, outstrips the guide,<br />
So him, though swift, the river always reach'd<br />
Still swifter; who can cope with power divine?<br />
Oft as the noble Chief, turning, essay'd<span class="lnm">315</span><br />
Resistance, and to learn if all the Gods<br />
Alike rush'd after him, so oft the flood,<br />
Jove's offspring, laved his shoulders. Upward then<br />
He sprang distress'd, but with a sidelong sweep<br />
Assailing him, and from beneath his steps<span class="lnm">320</span><br />
Wasting the soil, the Stream his force subdued.<br />
Then looking to the skies, aloud he mourn'd.</p>
<p>  Eternal Sire! forsaken by the Gods<br />
I sink, none deigns to save me from the flood,<br />
From which once saved, I would no death decline.<span class="lnm">325</span><br />
Yet blame I none of all the Powers of heaven<br />
As Thetis; she with falsehood sooth'd my soul,<br />
She promised me a death by Ph&oelig;bus' shafts<br />
Swift-wing'd, beneath the battlements of Troy.<br />
I would that Hector, noblest of his race,<span class="lnm">330</span><br />
Had slain me, I had then bravely expired<br />
And a brave man had stripp'd me of my arms.<br />
But fate now dooms me to a death abhorr'd<br />
Whelm'd in deep waters, like a swine-herd's boy<br />
Drown'd in wet weather while he fords a brook.<span class="lnm">335</span></p>
<p>  So spake Achilles; then, in human form,<br />
Minerva stood and Neptune at his side;<br />
Each seized his hand confirming him, and thus<br />
The mighty Shaker of the shores began.</p>
<p>  Achilles! moderate thy dismay, fear nought.<span class="lnm">340</span><br />
In us behold, in Pallas and in me,<br />
Effectual aids, and with consent of Jove;<br />
For to be vanquish'd by a River's force<br />
Is not thy doom. This foe shall soon be quell'd;<br />
Thine eyes shall see it. Let our counsel rule<span class="lnm">345</span><br />
Thy deed, and all is well. Cease not from war<br />
Till fast within proud Ilium's walls her host<br />
<span class="pgnm">523</span><a name="page_523" id="page_523"></a>
Again be prison'd, all who shall escape;<br />
Then (Hector slain) to the Achaian fleet<br />
Return; we make the glorious victory thine.<span class="lnm">350</span></p>
<p>  So they, and both departing sought the skies.<br />
Then, animated by the voice divine,<br />
He moved toward the plain now all o'erspread<br />
By the vast flood on which the bodies swam<br />
And shields of many a youth in battle slain.<span class="lnm">355</span><br />
He leap'd, he waded, and the current stemm'd<br />
Right onward, by the flood in vain opposed,<br />
With such might Pallas fill'd him. Nor his rage<br />
Scamander aught repress'd, but still the more<br />
Incensed against Achilles, curl'd aloft<span class="lnm">360</span><br />
His waters, and on Simo&iuml;s call'd aloud.</p>
<p>  Brother! oh let us with united force<br />
Check, if we may, this warrior; he shall else<br />
Soon lay the lofty towers of Priam low,<br />
Whose host appall'd, defend them now no more.<span class="lnm">365</span><br />
Haste&mdash;succor me&mdash;thy channel fill with streams<br />
From all thy fountains; call thy torrents down;<br />
Lift high the waters; mingle trees and stones<br />
With uproar wild, that we may quell the force<br />
Of this dread Chief triumphant now, and fill'd<span class="lnm">370</span><br />
With projects that might more beseem a God.<br />
But vain shall be his strength, his beauty nought<br />
Shall profit him or his resplendent arms,<br />
For I will bury them in slime and ooze,<br />
And I will overwhelm himself with soil,<span class="lnm">375</span><br />
Sands heaping o'er him and around him sands<br />
Infinite, that no Greek shall find his bones<br />
For ever, in my bottom deep immersed.<br />
There shall his tomb be piled, nor other earth,<br />
At his last rites, his friends shall need for him.<span class="lnm">380</span></p>
<p>  He said, and lifting high his angry tide<br />
Vortiginous, against Achilles hurl'd,<br />
Roaring, the foam, the bodies, and the blood;<br />
Then all his sable waves divine again<br />
Accumulating, bore him swift along.<span class="lnm">385</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">524</span><a name="page_524" id="page_524"></a>
Shriek'd Juno at that sight, terrified lest<br />
Achilles in the whirling deluge sunk<br />
Should perish, and to Vulcan quick exclaim'd.</p>
<p>  Vulcan, my son, arise; for we account<br />
Xanthus well able to contend with thee.<span class="lnm">390</span><br />
Give instant succor; show forth all thy fires.<br />
Myself will haste to call the rapid South<br />
And Zephyrus, that tempests from the sea<br />
Blowing, thou may'st both arms and dead consume<br />
With hideous conflagration. Burn along<span class="lnm">395</span><br />
The banks of Xanthus, fire his trees and him<br />
Seize also. Let him by no specious guile<br />
Of flattery soothe thee, or by threats appall,<br />
Nor slack thy furious fires 'till with a shout<br />
I give command, then bid them cease to blaze.<span class="lnm">400</span></p>
<p>  She spake, and Vulcan at her word his fires<br />
Shot dreadful forth; first, kindling on the field,<br />
He burn'd the bodies strew'd numerous around<br />
Slain by Achilles; arid grew the earth<br />
And the flood ceased. As when a sprightly breeze<span class="lnm">405</span><br />
Autumnal blowing from the North, at once<br />
Dries the new-water'd garden,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_21-7">[7]</a> gladdening him<br />
Who tills the soil, so was the champain dried;<br />
The dead consumed, against the River, next,<br />
He turn'd the fierceness of his glittering fires.<span class="lnm">410</span><br />
Willows and tamarisks and elms he burn'd,<br />
Burn'd lotus, rushes, reeds; all plants and herbs<br />
That clothed profuse the margin of his flood.<br />
His eels and fishes, whether wont to dwell<br />
In gulfs beneath, or tumble in the stream,<span class="lnm">415</span><br />
All languish'd while the artist of the skies<br />
Breath'd on them; even Xanthus lost, himself,<br />
All force, and, suppliant, Vulcan thus address'd.</p>
<p>  Oh Vulcan! none in heaven itself may cope<br />
With thee. I yield to thy consuming fires.<span class="lnm">420</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">525</span><a name="page_525" id="page_525"></a>
Cease, cease. I reck not if Achilles drive<br />
Her citizens, this moment, forth from Troy,<br />
For what are war and war's concerns to me?</p>
<p>  So spake he scorch'd, and all his waters boil'd.<br />
As some huge caldron hisses urged by force<span class="lnm">425</span><br />
Of circling fires and fill'd with melted lard,<br />
The unctuous fluid overbubbling<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_21-8">[8]</a> streams<br />
On all sides, while the dry wood flames beneath,<br />
So Xanthus bubbled and his pleasant flood<br />
Hiss'd in the fire, nor could he longer flow<span class="lnm">430</span><br />
But check'd his current, with hot steams annoy'd<br />
By Vulcan raised. His supplication, then,<br />
Importunate to Juno thus he turn'd.</p>
<p>  Ah Juno! why assails thy son my streams,<br />
Hostile to me alone? Of all who aid<span class="lnm">435</span><br />
The Trojans I am surely least to blame,<br />
Yet even I desist if thou command;<br />
And let thy son cease also; for I swear<br />
That never will I from the Trojans turn<br />
Their evil day, not even when the host<span class="lnm">440</span><br />
Of Greece shall set all Ilium in a blaze.</p>
<p>  He said, and by his oath pacified, thus<br />
The white-arm'd Deity to Vulcan spake.</p>
<p>  Peace, glorious son! we may not in behalf<br />
Of mortal man thus longer vex a God.<span class="lnm">445</span></p>
<p>  Then Vulcan his tremendous fires repress'd,<br />
And down into his gulfy channel rush'd<br />
The refluent flood; for when the force was once<br />
Subdued of Xanthus, Juno interposed,<br />
Although incensed, herself to quell the strife.<span class="lnm">450</span></p>
<p>  But contest vehement the other Gods<br />
Now waged, each breathing discord; loud they rush'd<br />
And fierce to battle, while the boundless earth<br />
Quaked under them, and, all around, the heavens<br />
Sang them together with a trumpet's voice.<span class="lnm">455</span><br />
Jove listening, on the Olympian summit sat<br />
Well-pleased, and, in his heart laughing for joy,<br />
<span class="pgnm">526</span><a name="page_526" id="page_526"></a>
Beheld the Powers of heaven in battle join'd.<br />
Not long aloof they stood. Shield-piercer Mars,<br />
His brazen spear grasp'd, and began the fight<span class="lnm">460</span><br />
Rushing on Pallas, whom he thus reproach'd.</p>
<p>  Wasp! front of impudence, and past all bounds<br />
Audacious! Why impellest thou the Gods<br />
To fight? Thy own proud spirit is the cause.<br />
Remember'st not, how, urged by thee, the son<span class="lnm">465</span><br />
Of Tydeus, Diomede, myself assail'd,<br />
When thou, the radiant spear with thy own hand<br />
Guiding, didst rend my body? Now, I ween,<br />
The hour is come in which I shall exact<br />
Vengeance for all thy malice shown to me.<span class="lnm">470</span></p>
<p>  So saying, her shield he smote tassell'd around<br />
Terrific, proof against the bolts of Jove;<br />
That shield gore-tainted Mars with fury smote.<br />
But she, retiring, with strong grasp upheaved<br />
A rugged stone, black, ponderous, from the plain,<span class="lnm">475</span><br />
A land-mark fixt by men of ancient times,<br />
Which hurling at the neck of stormy Mars<br />
She smote him. Down he fell. Seven acres, stretch'd,<br />
He overspread, his ringlets in the dust<br />
Polluted lay, and dreadful rang his arms.<span class="lnm">480</span><br />
The Goddess laugh'd, and thus in accents wing'd<br />
With exultation, as he lay, exclaim'd.</p>
<p>  Fool! Art thou still to learn how far my force<br />
Surpasses thine, and darest thou cope with me?<br />
Now feel the furies of thy mother's ire<span class="lnm">485</span><br />
Who hates thee for thy treachery to the Greeks,<br />
And for thy succor given to faithless Troy.</p>
<p>  She said, and turn'd from Mars her glorious eyes.<br />
But him deep-groaning and his torpid powers<br />
Recovering slow, Venus conducted thence<span class="lnm">490</span><br />
Daughter of Jove, whom soon as Juno mark'd,<br />
In accents wing'd to Pallas thus she spake.</p>
<p>  Daughter invincible of glorious Jove!<br />
Haste&mdash;follow her&mdash;Ah shameless! how she leads<br />
Gore-tainted Mars through all the host of heaven.<span class="lnm">495</span></p>
<p><span class="pgnm">527</span><a name="page_527" id="page_527"></a>
  So she, whom Pallas with delight obey'd;<br />
To Venus swift she flew, and on the breast<br />
With such force smote her that of sense bereft<br />
The fainting Goddess fell. There Venus lay<br />
And Mars extended on the fruitful glebe,<span class="lnm">500</span><br />
And Pallas thus in accents wing'd exclaim'd.</p>
<p>  I would that all who on the part of Troy<br />
Oppose in fight Achaia's valiant sons,<br />
Were firm and bold as Venus in defence<br />
Of Mars, for whom she dared my power defy!<span class="lnm">505</span><br />
So had dissension (Ilium overthrown<br />
And desolated) ceased long since in heaven.</p>
<p>  So Pallas, and approving Juno smiled.<br />
Then the imperial Shaker of the shores<br />
Thus to Apollo. Ph&oelig;bus! wherefore stand<span class="lnm">510</span><br />
<i>We</i> thus aloof? Since others have begun,<br />
Begin we also; shame it were to both<br />
Should we, no combat waged, ascend again<br />
Olympus and the brass-built hall of Jove.<br />
Begin, for thou art younger; me, whose years<span class="lnm">515</span><br />
Alike and knowledge thine surpass so far,<br />
It suits not. Oh stupidity! how gross<br />
Art thou and senseless! Are no traces left<br />
In thy remembrance of our numerous wrongs<br />
Sustain'd at Ilium, when, of all the Gods<span class="lnm">520</span><br />
Ourselves alone, by Jove's commandment, served<br />
For stipulated hire, a year complete,<br />
Our task-master the proud Laomedon?<br />
Myself a bulwark'd town, spacious, secure<br />
Against assault, and beautiful as strong<span class="lnm">525</span><br />
Built for the Trojans, and thine office was<br />
To feed for King Laomedon his herds<br />
Among the groves of Ida many-valed.<br />
But when the gladsome hours the season brought<br />
Of payment, then the unjust King of Troy<span class="lnm">530</span><br />
Dismiss'd us of our whole reward amerced<br />
By violence, and added threats beside.<br />
Thee into distant isles, bound hand and foot,<br />
<span class="pgnm">528</span><a name="page_528" id="page_528"></a>
To sell he threatened, and to amputate<br />
The ears of both; we, therefore, hasted thence<span class="lnm">535</span><br />
Resenting deep our promised hire withheld.<br />
Aid'st thou for this the Trojans? Canst thou less<br />
Than seek, with us, to exterminate the whole<br />
Perfidious race, wives, children, husbands, all?</p>
<p>  To whom the King of radiant shafts Apollo.<span class="lnm">540</span><br />
Me, Neptune, thou wouldst deem, thyself, unwise<br />
Contending for the sake of mortal men<br />
With thee; a wretched race, who like the leaves<br />
Now flourish rank, by fruits of earth sustain'd,<br />
Now sapless fall. Here, therefore, us between<span class="lnm">545</span><br />
Let all strife cease, far better left to them.</p>
<p>  He said, and turn'd away, fearing to lift<br />
His hand against the brother of his sire.<br />
But him Diana of the woods with sharp<br />
Rebuke, his huntress sister, thus reproved.<span class="lnm">550</span></p>
<p>  Fly'st thou, Apollo! and to Neptune yield'st<br />
An unearn'd victory, the prize of fame<br />
Resigning patient and with no dispute?<br />
Fool! wherefore bearest thou the bow in vain?<br />
Ah, let me never in my father's courts<span class="lnm">555</span><br />
Hear thee among the immortals vaunting more<br />
That thou wouldst Neptune's self confront in arms.</p>
<p>  So she, to whom Apollo nought replied.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_21-9">[9]</a><br />
But thus the consort of the Thunderer, fired<br />
With wrath, reproved the Archeress of heaven.<span class="lnm">560</span></p>
<p>  How hast thou dared, impudent, to oppose<br />
My will? Bow-practised as thou art, the task<br />
To match my force were difficult to thee.<br />
Is it, because by ordinance of Jove<br />
Thou art a lioness to womankind,<span class="lnm">565</span><br />
Killing them at thy pleasure? Ah beware&mdash;<br />
Far easier is it, on the mountain-heights<br />
<span class="pgnm">529</span><a name="page_529" id="page_529"></a>
To slay wild beasts and chase the roving hind,<br />
Than to conflict with mightier than ourselves.<br />
But, if thou wish a lesson on that theme,<span class="lnm">570</span><br />
Approach&mdash;thou shalt be taught with good effect<br />
How far my force in combat passes thine.</p>
<p>  She said, and with her left hand seizing both<br />
Diana's wrists, snatch'd suddenly the bow<br />
Suspended on her shoulder with the right,<span class="lnm">575</span><br />
And, smiling, smote her with it on the ears.<br />
She, writhing oft and struggling, to the ground<br />
Shook forth her rapid shafts, then, weeping, fled<br />
As to her cavern in some hollow rock<br />
The dove, not destined to his talons, flies<span class="lnm">580</span><br />
The hawk's pursuit, and left her arms behind.</p>
<p>  Then, messenger of heaven, the Argicide<br />
Address'd Latona. Combat none with thee,<br />
Latona, will I wage. Unsafe it were<br />
To cope in battle with a spouse of Jove.<span class="lnm">585</span><br />
Go, therefore, loudly as thou wilt, proclaim<br />
To all the Gods that thou hast vanquish'd me.</p>
<p>  Collecting, then, the bow and arrows fallen<br />
In wild disorder on the dusty plain,<br />
Latona with the sacred charge withdrew<span class="lnm">590</span><br />
Following her daughter; she, in the abode<br />
Brass-built arriving of Olympian Jove,<br />
Sat on his knees, weeping till all her robe<br />
Ambrosial shook. The mighty Father smiled,<br />
And to his bosom straining her, inquired.<span class="lnm">595</span></p>
<p>  Daughter beloved! who, which of all the Gods<br />
Hath raised his hand, presumptuous, against thee,<br />
As if convicted of some open wrong?</p>
<p>  To whom the clear-voiced Huntress crescent-crown'd.<br />
My Father! Juno, thy own consort fair<span class="lnm">600</span><br />
My sorrow caused, from whom dispute and strife<br />
Perpetual, threaten the immortal Powers.</p>
<p>  Thus they in heaven mutual conferr'd. Meantime<br />
Apollo into sacred Troy return'd<br />
Mindful to guard her bulwarks, lest the Greeks<span class="lnm">605</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">530</span><a name="page_530" id="page_530"></a>
Too soon for Fate should desolate the town.<br />
The other Gods, some angry, some elate<br />
With victory, the Olympian heights regain'd,<br />
And sat beside the Thunderer. But the son<br />
Of Peleus&mdash;He both Trojans slew and steeds.<span class="lnm">610</span><br />
As when in volumes slow smoke climbs the skies<br />
From some great city which the Gods have fired<br />
Vindictive, sorrow thence to many ensues<br />
With mischief, and to all labor severe,<br />
So caused Achilles labor on that day,<span class="lnm">615</span><br />
Severe, and mischief to the men of Troy.</p>
<p>  But ancient Priam from a sacred tower<br />
Stood looking forth, whence soon he noticed vast<br />
Achilles, before whom the Trojans fled<br />
All courage lost. Descending from the tower<span class="lnm">620</span><br />
With mournful cries and hasting to the wall<br />
He thus enjoin'd the keepers of the gates.</p>
<p>  Hold wide the portals till the flying host<br />
Re-enter, for himself is nigh, himself<br />
Achilles drives them home. Now, wo to Troy!<span class="lnm">625</span><br />
But soon as safe within the walls received<br />
They breathe again, shut fast the ponderous gates<br />
At once, lest that destroyer also pass.</p>
<p>  He said; they, shooting back the bars, threw wide<br />
The gates and saved the people, whom to aid<span class="lnm">630</span><br />
Apollo also sprang into the field,<br />
They, parch'd with drought and whiten'd all with dust,<br />
Flew right toward the town, while, spear in hand,<br />
Achilles press'd them, vengeance in his heart<br />
And all on fire for glory. Then, full sure,<span class="lnm">635</span><br />
Ilium, the city of lofty gates, had fallen<br />
Won by the Grecians, had not Ph&oelig;bus roused<br />
Antenor's valiant son, the noble Chief<br />
Agenor; him with dauntless might he fill'd,<br />
And shielding him against the stroke of fate<span class="lnm">640</span><br />
Beside him stood himself, by the broad beech<br />
Cover'd and wrapt in clouds. Agenor then,<br />
Seeing the city-waster hero nigh<br />
<span class="pgnm">531</span><a name="page_531" id="page_531"></a>
Achilles, stood, but standing, felt his mind<br />
Troubled with doubts; he groan'd, and thus he mused.<span class="lnm">645</span></p>
<p>  <a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_21-10">[10]</a>Alas! if following the tumultuous flight<br />
Of these, I shun Achilles, swifter far<br />
He soon will lop my ignominious head.<br />
But if, these leaving to be thus dispersed<br />
Before him, from the city-wall I fly<span class="lnm">650</span><br />
Across the plain of Troy into the groves<br />
Of Ida, and in Ida's thickets lurk,<br />
I may, at evening, to the town return<br />
Bathed and refresh'd. But whither tend my thoughts?<br />
Should he my flight into the plain observe<span class="lnm">655</span><br />
And swift pursuing seize me, then, farewell<br />
All hope to scape a miserable death,<br />
For he hath strength passing the strength of man.<br />
How then&mdash;shall I withstand him here before<br />
The city? He hath also flesh to steel<span class="lnm">660</span><br />
Pervious, within it but a single life,<br />
And men report him mortal, howsoe'er<br />
Saturnian Jove lift him to glory now.</p>
<p>  So saying, he turn'd and stood, his dauntless heart<br />
Beating for battle. As the pard springs forth<span class="lnm">665</span><br />
To meet the hunter from her gloomy lair,<br />
Nor, hearing loud the hounds, fears or retires,<br />
But whether from afar or nigh at hand<br />
He pierce her first, although transfixt, the fight<br />
Still tries, and combats desperate till she fall,<span class="lnm">670</span><br />
So, brave Antenor's son fled not, or shrank,<br />
Till he had proved Achilles, but his breast<br />
O'ershadowing with his buckler and his spear<br />
Aiming well-poised against him, loud exclaim'd.</p>
<p>  Renown'd Achilles! Thou art high in hope<span class="lnm">675</span><br />
Doubtless, that thou shalt this day overthrow<br />
The city of the glorious sons of Troy.<br />
Fool! ye must labor yet ere she be won,<br />
<span class="pgnm">532</span><a name="page_532" id="page_532"></a>
For numerous are her citizens and bold,<br />
And we will guard her for our parents' sake<span class="lnm">680</span><br />
Our wives and little ones. But here thou diest<br />
Terrible Chief and dauntless as thou art.</p>
<p>  He said, and with full force hurling his lance<br />
Smote, and err'd not, his greave beneath his knee<br />
The glittering tin, forged newly, at the stroke<span class="lnm">685</span><br />
Tremendous rang, but quick recoil'd and vain<br />
The weapon, weak against that guard divine.<br />
Then sprang Achilles in his turn to assail<br />
Godlike Agenor, but Apollo took<br />
That glory from him, snatching wrapt in clouds<span class="lnm">690</span><br />
Agenor thence, whom calm he sent away.</p>
<p>  Then Ph&oelig;bus from pursuit of Ilium's host<br />
By art averted Peleus' son; the form<br />
Assuming of Agenor, swift he fled<br />
Before him, and Achilles swift pursued.<span class="lnm">695</span><br />
While him Apollo thus lured to the chase<br />
Wide o'er the fruitful plain, inclining still<br />
Toward Scamander's dizzy stream his course<br />
Nor flying far before, but with false hope<br />
Always beguiling him, the scatter'd host<span class="lnm">700</span><br />
Meantime, in joyful throngs, regain'd the town.<br />
They fill'd and shut it fast, nor dared to wait<br />
Each other in the field, or to inquire<br />
Who lived and who had fallen, but all, whom flight<br />
Had rescued, like a flood pour'd into Troy.<span class="lnm">705</span></p>

<p>The Trojans being now within the city, excepting Hector, the field is
cleared for the most important and decisive action in the poem; that is, the
battle between Achilles and Hector, and the death of the latter. This part
of the story is managed with singular skill. It seems as if the poet, feeling
the importance of the catastrophe, wished to withdraw from view the personages
of less consequence, and to concentrate our attention upon those two
alone. The poetic action and description are narrowed in extent, but deepened
in interest. The fate of Troy is impending; the irreversible decree of
Jupiter is about to be executed; the heroes, whose bravery is to be the instrument
of bringing about this consummation, are left together on the plain.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Felton</span>.</p>

<p class="noind">Thus they, throughout all Troy, like hunted fawns<br />
Dispersed, their trickling limbs at leisure cool'd,<br />
And, drinking, slaked their fiery thirst, reclined<br />
Against the battlements. Meantime, the Greeks<br />
Sloping their shields, approach'd the walls of Troy,<span class="lnm">5</span><br />
And Hector, by his adverse fate ensnared,<br />
Still stood exposed before the Sc&aelig;an gate.<br />
Then spake Apollo thus to Peleus' son.</p>
<p>  Wherefore, thyself mortal, pursuest thou me<br />
Immortal? oh Achilles! blind with rage,<span class="lnm">10</span><br />
Thou know'st not yet, that thou pursuest a God.<br />
Unmindful of thy proper task, to press<br />
The flying Trojans, thou hast hither turn'd<br />
Devious, and they are all now safe in Troy;<br />
Yet hope me not to slay; I cannot die.<span class="lnm">15</span></p>

Thou hast beguiled me, leading me away<br />
From Ilium far, whence intercepted, else,<span class="lnm">20</span><br />
No few had at this moment gnaw'd the glebe.<br />
Thou hast defrauded me of great renown,<br />

So beam'd Achilles' armor as he flew.<span class="lnm">35</span><br />
Loud wail'd the hoary King; with lifted hands<br />
His head he smote, and, uttering doleful cries<br />
Of supplication, sued to his own son.<br />
He, fixt before the gate, desirous stood<br />
Of combat with Achilles, when his sire<span class="lnm">40</span><br />
With arms outstretch'd toward him, thus began.</p>
<p>  My Hector! wait not, oh my son! the approach<br />
Of this dread Chief, alone, lest premature<br />
Thou die, this moment by Achilles slain,<br />
For he is strongest far. Oh that the Gods<span class="lnm">45</span><br />
Him loved as I! then, soon should vultures rend<br />
And dogs his carcase, and my grief should cease.<br />
He hath unchilded me of many a son,<br />
All valiant youths, whom he hath slain or sold<br />
To distant isles, and even now, I miss<span class="lnm">50</span><br />
Two sons, whom since the shutting of the gates<br />
I find not, Polydorus and Lycaon,<br />
My children by Laoth&ouml;e the fair.<br />
If they survive prisoners in yonder camp,<br />
I will redeem them with gold and brass<span class="lnm">55</span><br />
By noble Eltes to his daughter given,<br />
Large store, and still reserved. But should they both,<br />
Already slain, have journey'd to the shades,<br />
We, then, from whom they sprang have cause to mourn<br />
<span class="pgnm">537</span><a name="page_537" id="page_537"></a>
And mourn them long, but shorter shall the grief<span class="lnm">60</span><br />
Of Ilium prove, if thou escape and live.<br />
Come then, my son! enter the city-gate<br />
That thou may'st save us all, nor in thy bloom<br />
Of life cut off, enhance Achilles' fame.<br />
Commiserate also thy unhappy sire<span class="lnm">65</span><br />
Ere yet distracted, whom Saturnian Jove<br />
Ordains to a sad death, and ere I die<br />
To woes innumerable; to behold<br />
Sons slaughter'd, daughters ravish'd, torn and stripp'd<br />
The matrimonial chamber, infants dash'd<span class="lnm">70</span><br />
Against the ground in dire hostility,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_22-2">[2]</a><br />
And matrons dragg'd by ruthless Grecian hands.<br />
Me, haply, last of all, dogs shall devour<br />
In my own vestibule, when once the spear<br />
Or falchion of some Greek hath laid me low.<span class="lnm">75</span><br />
The very dogs fed at my table-side,<br />
My portal-guards, drinking their master's blood<br />
To drunkenness, shall wallow in my courts.<br />
Fair falls the warlike youth in battle slain,<br />
And when he lies torn by the pointed steel,<span class="lnm">80</span><br />
His death becomes him well; he is secure,<br />
Though dead, from shame, whatever next befalls:<br />
But when the silver locks and silver beard<br />
Of an old man slain by the sword, from dogs<br />
Receive dishonor, of all ills that wait<span class="lnm">85</span><br />
On miserable man, that sure is worst.</p>
<p>  So spake the ancient King, and his grey hairs<br />
Pluck'd with both hands, but Hector firm endured.<br />
On the other side all tears his mother stood,<br />
And lamentation; with one hand she bared,<span class="lnm">90</span><br />
And with the other hand produced her breast,<br />
Then in wing'd accents, weeping, him bespake.</p>
<p>  My Hector! reverence this, and pity me<br />
<span class="pgnm">538</span><a name="page_538" id="page_538"></a>
If ever, drawing forth this breast, thy griefs<br />
Of infancy I soothed, oh now, my son!<span class="lnm">95</span><br />
Acknowledge it, and from within the walls<br />
Repulse this enemy; stand not abroad<br />
To cope with <i>him</i>, for he is savage-fierce,<br />
And should he slay thee, neither shall myself<br />
Who bore thee, nor thy noble spouse weep o'er<span class="lnm">100</span><br />
Thy body, but, where we can never come,<br />
Dogs shall devour it in the fleet of Greece.</p>
<p>  So they with prayers importuned, and with tears<br />
Their son, but him sway'd not; unmoved he stood,<br />
Expecting vast Achilles now at hand.<span class="lnm">105</span><br />
As some fell serpent in his cave expects<br />
The traveller's approach, batten'd with herbs<br />
Of baneful juice to fury,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_22-3">[3]</a> forth he looks<br />
Hideous, and lies coil'd all around his den,<br />
So Hector, fill'd with confidence untamed,<span class="lnm">110</span><br />
Fled not, but placing his bright shield against<br />
A buttress, with his noble heart conferr'd.</p>
<p>  <a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_22-4">[4]</a>Alas for me! should I repass the gate,<br />
Polydamas would be the first to heap<br />
Reproaches on me, for he bade me lead<span class="lnm">115</span><br />
The Trojans back this last calamitous night<br />
In which Achilles rose to arms again.<br />
But I refused, although to have complied,<br />
Had proved more profitable far; since then<br />
By rash resolves of mine I have destroy'd<span class="lnm">120</span><br />
The people, how can I escape the blame<br />
Of all in Troy? The meanest there will say&mdash;<br />
<span class="pgnm">539</span><a name="page_539" id="page_539"></a>
By his self-will he hath destroy'd us all.<br />
So shall they speak, and then shall I regret<br />
That I return'd ere I had slain in fight<span class="lnm">125</span><br />
Achilles, or that, by Achilles slain,<br />
I died not nobly in defence of Troy.<br />
But shall I thus? Lay down my bossy shield,<br />
Put off my helmet, and my spear recline<br />
Against the city wall, then go myself<span class="lnm">130</span><br />
To meet the brave Achilles, and at once<br />
Promise him Helen, for whose sake we strive<br />
With all the wealth that Paris in his fleet<br />
Brought home, to be restored to Atreus' sons,<br />
And to distribute to the Greeks at large<span class="lnm">135</span><br />
All hidden treasures of the town, an oath<br />
Taking beside from every senator,<br />
That he will nought conceal, but will produce<br />
And share in just equality what stores<br />
Soever our fair city still includes?<span class="lnm">140</span><br />
Ah airy speculations, questions vain!<br />
I may not sue to him: compassion none<br />
Will he vouchsafe me, or my suit respect.<br />
But, seeing me unarm'd, will sate at once<br />
His rage, and womanlike I shall be slain.<span class="lnm">145</span><br />
It is no time from oak or hollow rock<br />
With him to parley, as a nymph and swain,<br />
A nymph and swain<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_22-5">[5]</a> soft parley mutual hold,<br />
But rather to engage in combat fierce<br />
Incontinent; so shall we soonest learn<span class="lnm">150</span><br />
Whom Jove will make victorious, him or me.</p>
<p>  Thus pondering he stood; meantime approach'd<br />
Achilles, terrible as fiery Mars,<br />
Crest-tossing God, and brandish'd as he came<br />
O'er his right shoulder high the Pelian spear.<span class="lnm">155</span><br />
Like lightning, or like flame, or like the sun<br />
<span class="pgnm">540</span><a name="page_540" id="page_540"></a>
Ascending, beam'd his armor. At that sight<br />
Trembled the Trojan Chief, nor dared expect<br />
His nearer step, but flying left the gates<br />
Far distant, and Achilles swift pursued.<span class="lnm">160</span><br />
As in the mountains, fleetest fowl of air,<br />
The hawk darts eager at the dove; she scuds<br />
Aslant, he screaming, springs and springs again<br />
To seize her, all impatient for the prey,<br />
So flew Achilles constant to the track<span class="lnm">165</span><br />
Of Hector, who with dreadful haste beneath<br />
The Trojan bulwarks plied his agile limbs.<br />
Passing the prospect-mount where high in air<br />
The wild-fig waved,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_22-6">[6]</a> they rush'd along the road,<br />
Declining never from the wall of Troy.<span class="lnm">170</span><br />
And now they reach'd the running rivulets clear,<br />
Where from Scamander's dizzy flood arise<br />
Two fountains,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_22-7">[7]</a> tepid one, from which a smoke<br />
Issues voluminous as from a fire,<br />
The other, even in summer heats, like hail<span class="lnm">175</span><br />
For cold, or snow, or crystal-stream frost-bound.<br />
Beside them may be seen the broad canals<br />
Of marble scoop'd, in which the wives of Troy<br />
And all her daughters fair were wont to lave<br />
Their costly raiment,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_22-8">[8]</a> while the land had rest,<span class="lnm">180</span><br />
And ere the warlike sons of Greece arrived.<br />
By these they ran, one fleeing, one in chase.<br />
Valiant was he who fled, but valiant far<br />
Beyond him he who urged the swift pursuit;<br />
Nor ran they for a vulgar prize, a beast<span class="lnm">185</span><br />
For sacrifice, or for the hide of such,<br />
The swift foot-racer's customary meed,<br />
<span class="pgnm">541</span><a name="page_541" id="page_541"></a>
But for the noble Hector's life they ran.<br />
As when two steeds, oft conquerors, trim the goal<br />
For some illustrious prize, a tripod bright<span class="lnm">190</span><br />
Or beauteous virgin, at a funeral game,<br />
So they with nimble feet the city thrice<br />
Of Priam compass'd. All the Gods look'd on,<br />
And thus the Sire of Gods and men began.</p>
<p>  Ah&mdash;I behold a warrior dear to me<span class="lnm">195</span><br />
Around the walls of Ilium driven, and grieve<br />
For Hector, who the thighs of fatted bulls<br />
On yonder heights of Ida many-valed<br />
Burn'd oft to me, and in the heights of Troy:<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_22-9">[9]</a><br />
But him Achilles, glorious Chief, around<span class="lnm">200</span><br />
The city walls of Priam now pursues.<br />
Consider this, ye Gods! weigh the event.<br />
Shall we from death save Hector? or, at length,<br />
Leave him, although in battle high renown'd,<br />
To perish by the might of Peleus' son?<span class="lnm">205</span></p>
<p>  Whom answer'd thus Pallas cerulean-eyed.<br />
Dread Sovereign of the storms! what hast thou said?<br />
Wouldst thou deliver from the stroke of fate<br />
A mortal man death-destined from of old?<br />
Do it; but small thy praise shall be in heaven.<span class="lnm">210</span></p>
<p>  Then answer thus, cloud-gatherer Jove return'd.<br />
Fear not, Tritonia, daughter dear! that word<br />
Spake not my purpose; me thou shalt perceive<br />
Always to thee indulgent. What thou wilt<br />
That execute, and use thou no delay.<span class="lnm">215</span></p>
<p>  So roused he Pallas of herself prepared,<br />
And from the heights Olympian down she flew.<br />
With unremitting speed Achilles still<br />
Urged Hector. As among the mountain-height<br />
The hound pursues, roused newly from her lair<span class="lnm">220</span><br />
The flying fawn through many a vale and grove;<br />
And though she trembling skulk the shrubs beneath,<br />
<span class="pgnm">542</span><a name="page_542" id="page_542"></a>
Tracks her continual, till he find the prey,<br />
So 'scaped not Hector Peleus' rapid son.<br />
Oft as toward the Dardan gates he sprang<span class="lnm">225</span><br />
Direct, and to the bulwarks firm of Troy,<br />
Hoping some aid by volleys from the wall,<br />
So oft, outstripping him, Achilles thence<br />
Enforced him to the field, who, as he might,<br />
Still ever stretch'd toward the walls again.<span class="lnm">230</span><br />
As, in a dream,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_22-10">[10]</a> pursuit hesitates oft,<br />
This hath no power to fly, that to pursue,<br />
So these&mdash;one fled, and one pursued in vain.<br />
How, then, had Hector his impending fate<br />
Eluded, had not Ph&oelig;bus, at his last,<span class="lnm">235</span><br />
Last effort meeting him, his strength restored,<br />
And wing'd for flight his agile limbs anew?<br />
The son of Peleus, as he ran, his brows<br />
Shaking, forbad the people to dismiss<br />
A dart at Hector, lest a meaner hand<span class="lnm">240</span><br />
Piercing him, should usurp the foremost praise.<br />
But when the fourth time to those rivulets.<br />
They came, then lifting high his golden scales,<br />
Two lots the everlasting Father placed<br />
Within them, for Achilles one, and one<span class="lnm">245</span><br />
For Hector, balancing the doom of both.<br />
Grasping it in the midst, he raised the beam.<br />
Down went the fatal day of Hector, down<br />
To Ades, and Apollo left his side.<br />
Then blue-eyed Pallas hasting to the son<span class="lnm">250</span><br />
Of Peleus, in wing'd accents him address'd.</p>
<p>  Now, dear to Jove, Achilles famed in arms!<br />
I hope that, fierce in combat though he be,<br />
We shall, at last, slay Hector, and return<br />
Crown'd with great glory to the fleet of Greece.<span class="lnm">255</span><br />
No fear of his deliverance now remains,<br />
Not even should the King of radiant shafts,<br />
Apollo, toil in supplication, roll'd<br />
<span class="pgnm">543</span><a name="page_543" id="page_543"></a>
And roll'd again<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_22-11">[11]</a> before the Thunderer's feet.<br />
But stand, recover breath; myself, the while,<span class="lnm">260</span><br />
Shall urge him to oppose thee face to face.</p>
<p>  So Pallas spake, whom joyful he obey'd,<br />
And on his spear brass-pointed lean'd. But she,<br />
(Achilles left) to noble Hector pass'd,<br />
And in the form, and with the voice loud-toned<span class="lnm">265</span><br />
Approaching of Deiphobus, his ear<br />
In accents, as of pity, thus address'd.</p>
<p>  Ah brother! thou art overtask'd, around<br />
The walls of Troy by swift Achilles driven;<br />
But stand, that we may chase him in his turn.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_22-12">[12]</a><span class="lnm">270</span></p>
<p>  To whom crest-tossing Hector huge replied.<br />
Deiphobus! of all my father's sons<br />
Brought forth by Hecuba, I ever loved<br />
Thee most, but more than ever love thee now,<br />
Who hast not fear'd, seeing me, for my sake<span class="lnm">275</span><br />
To quit the town, where others rest content.</p>
<p>  To whom the Goddess, thus, cerulean-eyed.<br />
Brother! our parents with much earnest suit<br />
Clasping my knees, and all my friends implored me<br />
To stay in Troy, (such fear hath seized on all)<span class="lnm">280</span><br />
But grief for thee prey'd on my inmost soul.<br />
Come&mdash;fight we bravely&mdash;spare we now our spears<br />
No longer; now for proof if Peleus' son<br />
Slaying us both, shall bear into the fleet<br />
Our arms gore-stain'd, or perish slain by thee.<span class="lnm">285</span></p>
<p>  So saying, the wily Goddess led the way.<br />
They soon, approaching each the other, stood<br />
Opposite, and huge Hector thus began.</p>
<p>  Pelides! I will fly thee now no more.<br />
Thrice I have compass'd Priam's spacious walls<span class="lnm">290</span><br />
A fugitive, and have not dared abide<br />
Thy onset, but my heart now bids me stand<br />
Dauntless, and I will slay, or will be slain.<br />
<span class="pgnm">544</span><a name="page_544" id="page_544"></a>
But come. We will attest the Gods; for they<br />
Are fittest both to witness and to guard<span class="lnm">295</span><br />
Our covenant. If Jove to me vouchsafe<br />
The hard-earn'd victory, and to take thy life,<br />
I will not with dishonor foul insult<br />
Thy body, but, thine armor stripp'd, will give<br />
Thee to thy friends, as thou shalt me to mine.<span class="lnm">300</span></p>
<p>  To whom Achilles, lowering dark, replied.<br />
Hector! my bitterest foe! speak not to me<br />
Of covenants! as concord can be none<br />
Lions and men between, nor wolves and lambs<br />
Can be unanimous, but hate perforce<span class="lnm">305</span><br />
Each other by a law not to be changed,<br />
So cannot amity subsist between<br />
Thee and myself; nor league make I with thee<br />
Or compact, till thy blood in battle shed<br />
Or mine, shall gratify the fiery Mars.<span class="lnm">310</span><br />
Rouse all thy virtue; thou hast utmost need<br />
Of valor now, and of address in arms.<br />
Escape me more thou canst not; Pallas' hand<br />
By mine subdues thee; now will I avenge<br />
At once the agonies of every Greek<span class="lnm">315</span><br />
In thy unsparing fury slain by thee.</p>
<p>  He said, and, brandishing the Pelian ash,<br />
Dismiss'd it; but illustrious Hector warn'd,<br />
Crouched low, and, overflying him, it pierced<br />
The soil beyond, whence Pallas plucking it<span class="lnm">320</span><br />
Unseen, restored it to Achilles' hand,<br />
And Hector to his godlike foe replied.</p>
<p>  Godlike Achilles! thou hast err'd, nor know'st<br />
At all my doom from Jove, as thou pretend'st,<br />
But seek'st, by subtlety and wind of words,<span class="lnm">325</span><br />
All empty sounds, to rob me of my might.<br />
Yet stand I firm. Think not to pierce my back.<br />
Behold my bosom! if the Gods permit,<br />
Meet me advancing, and transpierce me there.<br />
Meantime avoid my glittering spear, but oh<span class="lnm">330</span><br />
May'st thou receive it all! since lighter far<br />
<span class="pgnm">545</span><a name="page_545" id="page_545"></a>
To Ilium should the toils of battle prove,<br />
Wert thou once slain, the fiercest of her foes.</p>
<p>  He said, and hurling his long spear with aim<br />
Unerring, smote the centre of the shield<span class="lnm">335</span><br />
Of Peleus' son, but his spear glanced away.<br />
He, angry to have sent it forth in vain,<br />
(For he had other none) with eyes downcast<br />
Stood motionless awhile, then with loud voice<br />
Sought from Deiphobus, white-shielded Chief,<span class="lnm">340</span><br />
A second; but Deiphobus was gone.<br />
Then Hector understood his doom, and said.</p>
<p>  Ah, it is plain; this is mine hour to die.<br />
I thought Deiphobus at hand, but me<br />
Pallas beguiled, and he is still in Troy.<span class="lnm">345</span><br />
A bitter death threatens me, it is nigh,<br />
And there is no escape; Jove, and Jove's son<br />
Apollo, from the first, although awhile<br />
My prompt deliverers, chose this lot for me,<br />
And now it finds me. But I will not fall<span class="lnm">350</span><br />
Inglorious; I will act some great exploit<br />
That shall be celebrated ages hence.</p>
<p>  So saying, his keen falchion from his side<br />
He drew, well-temper'd, ponderous, and rush'd<br />
At once to combat. As the eagle darts<span class="lnm">355</span><br />
Right downward through a sullen cloud to seize<br />
Weak lamb or timorous hare, so brandishing<br />
His splendid falchion, Hector rush'd to fight.<br />
Achilles, opposite, with fellest ire<br />
Full-fraught came on; his shield with various art<span class="lnm">360</span><br />
Celestial form'd, o'erspread his ample chest,<br />
And on his radiant casque terrific waved<br />
The bushy gold of his resplendent crest,<br />
By Vulcan spun, and pour'd profuse around.<br />
Bright as, among the stars, the star of all<span class="lnm">365</span><br />
Most radiant, Hesperus, at midnight moves,<br />
So, in the right hand of Achilles beam'd<br />
His brandish'd spear, while, meditating wo<br />
To Hector, he explored his noble form,<br />
<span class="pgnm">546</span><a name="page_546" id="page_546"></a>
Seeking where he was vulnerable most.<span class="lnm">370</span><br />
But every part, his dazzling armor torn<br />
From brave Patroclus' body, well secured,<br />
Save where the circling key-bone from the neck<br />
Disjoins the shoulder; there his throat appear'd,<br />
Whence injured life with swiftest flight escapes;<span class="lnm">375</span><br />
Achilles, plunging in that part his spear,<br />
Impell'd it through the yielding flesh beyond.<br />
The ashen beam his power of utterance left<br />
Still unimpair'd, but in the dust he fell,<br />
And the exulting conqueror exclaim'd.<span class="lnm">380</span></p>
<p>  But Hector! thou hadst once far other hopes,<br />
And, stripping slain Patroclus, thought'st thee safe,<br />
Nor caredst for absent me. Fond dream and vain!<br />
I was not distant far; in yonder fleet<br />
He left one able to avenge his death,<span class="lnm">385</span><br />
And he hath slain thee. Thee the dogs shall rend<br />
Dishonorably, and the fowls of air,<br />
But all Achaia's host shall him entomb.</p>
<p>  To whom the Trojan Chief languid replied.<br />
By thy own life, by theirs who gave thee birth,<span class="lnm">390</span><br />
And by thy knees,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_22-13">[13]</a> oh let not Grecian dogs<br />
Rend and devour me, but in gold accept<br />
And brass a ransom at my father's hands,<br />
And at my mother's an illustrious price;<br />
Send home my body, grant me burial rites<span class="lnm">395</span><br />
Among the daughters and the sons of Troy.</p>
<p>  To whom with aspect stern Achilles thus.<br />
Dog! neither knees nor parents name to me.<br />
I would my fierceness of revenge were such,<br />
That I could carve and eat thee, to whose arms<span class="lnm">400</span><br />
Such griefs I owe; so true it is and sure,<br />
That none shall save thy carcase from the dogs.<br />
No, trust me, would thy parents bring me weigh'd<br />
Ten&mdash;twenty ransoms, and engage on oath<br />
To add still more; would thy Dardanian Sire<span class="lnm">405</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">547</span><a name="page_547" id="page_547"></a>
Priam, redeem thee with thy weight in gold,<br />
Not even at that price would I consent<br />
That she who bare should place thee on thy bier<br />
With lamentation; dogs and ravening fowls<br />
Shall rend thy body while a scrap remains.<span class="lnm">410</span></p>
<p>  Then, dying, warlike Hector thus replied.<br />
Full well I knew before, how suit of mine<br />
Should speed preferr'd to thee. Thy heart is steel.<br />
But oh, while yet thou livest, think, lest the Gods<br />
Requite thee on that day, when pierced thyself<span class="lnm">415</span><br />
By Paris and Apollo, thou shalt fall,<br />
Brave as thou art, before the Sc&aelig;an gate.</p>
<p>  He ceased, and death involved him dark around.<br />
His spirit, from his limbs dismiss'd, the house<br />
Of Ades sought, mourning in her descent<span class="lnm">420</span><br />
Youth's prime and vigor lost, disastrous doom!<br />
But him though dead, Achilles thus bespake.</p>
<p>  Die thou. My death shall find me at what hour<br />
Jove gives commandment, and the Gods above.</p>
<p>  He spake, and from the dead drawing away<span class="lnm">425</span><br />
His brazen spear, placed it apart, then stripp'd<br />
His arms gore-stain'd. Meantime the other sons<br />
Of the Achaians, gathering fast around,<br />
The bulk admired, and the proportion just<br />
Of Hector; neither stood a Grecian there<span class="lnm">430</span><br />
Who pierced him not, and thus the soldier spake.</p>
<p>  Ye Gods! how far more patient of the touch<br />
Is Hector now, than when he fired the fleet!</p>
<p>  Thus would they speak, then give him each a stab.<br />
And now, the body stripp'd, their noble Chief<span class="lnm">435</span><br />
The swift Achilles standing in the midst,<br />
The Grecians in wing'd accents thus address'd.</p>
<p>  Friends, Chiefs and Senators of Argos' host!<br />
Since, by the will of heaven, this man is slain<br />
Who harm'd us more than all our foes beside,<span class="lnm">440</span><br />
Essay we next the city, so to learn<br />
The Trojan purpose, whether (Hector slain)<br />
They will forsake the citadel, or still<br />
<span class="pgnm">548</span><a name="page_548" id="page_548"></a>
Defend it, even though of him deprived.<br />
But wherefore speak I thus? still undeplored,<span class="lnm">445</span><br />
Unburied in my fleet Patroclus lies;<br />
Him never, while alive myself, I mix<br />
With living men and move, will I forget.<br />
In Ades, haply, they forget the dead,<br />
Yet will not I Patroclus, even there.<span class="lnm">450</span><br />
Now chanting p&aelig;ans, ye Achaian youths!<br />
Return we to the fleet with this our prize;<br />
We have achieved great glory,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_22-14">[14]</a> we have slain<br />
Illustrious Hector, him whom Ilium praised<br />
In all her gates, and as a God revered.<span class="lnm">455</span></p>
<p>  He said; then purposing dishonor foul<br />
To noble Hector, both his feet he bored<br />
From heel to ancle, and, inserting thongs,<br />
Them tied behind his chariot, but his head<br />
Left unsustain'd to trail along the ground.<span class="lnm">460</span><br />
Ascending next, the armor at his side<br />
He placed, then lash'd the steeds; they willing flew<br />
Thick dust around the body dragg'd arose,<br />
His sable locks all swept the plain, and all<br />
His head, so graceful once, now track'd the dust,<span class="lnm">465</span><br />
For Jove had given it into hostile hands<br />
That they might shame it in his native soil.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_22-15">[15]</a><br />
Thus, whelm'd in dust, it went. The mother Queen<br />
Her son beholding, pluck'd her hair away,<br />
Cast far aside her lucid veil, and fill'd<span class="lnm">470</span><br />
With shrieks the air. His father wept aloud,<br />
And, all around, long, long complaints were heard<br />
And lamentations in the streets of Troy,<br />
Not fewer or less piercing, than if flames<br />
<span class="pgnm">549</span><a name="page_549" id="page_549"></a>
Had wrapt all Ilium to her topmost towers.<span class="lnm">475</span><br />
His people scarce detain'd the ancient King<br />
Grief-stung, and resolute to issue forth<br />
Through the Dardanian gates; to all he kneel'd<br />
In turn, then roll'd himself in dust, and each<br />
By name solicited to give him way.<span class="lnm">480</span></p>
<p>  Stand off, my fellow mourners! I would pass<br />
The gates, would seek, alone, the Grecian fleet.<br />
I go to supplicate the bloody man,<br />
Yon ravager; he may respect, perchance,<br />
My years, may feel some pity of my age;<span class="lnm">485</span><br />
For, such as I am, his own father is,<br />
Peleus, who rear'd him for a curse to Troy,<br />
But chiefly rear'd him to myself a curse,<br />
So numerous have my sons in prime of youth<br />
Fall'n by his hand, all whom I less deplore<span class="lnm">490</span><br />
(Though mourning all) than one; my agonies<br />
For Hector soon shall send me to the shades.<br />
Oh had he but within these arms expired,<br />
The hapless Queen who bore him, and myself<br />
Had wept him, then, till sorrow could no more!<span class="lnm">495</span></p>
<p>  So spake he weeping, and the citizens<br />
All sigh'd around; next, Hecuba began<br />
Amid the women, thus, her sad complaint.</p>
<p>  Ah wherefore, oh my son! wretch that I am,<br />
Breathe I forlorn of thee? Thou, night and day,<span class="lnm">500</span><br />
My glory wast in Ilium, thee her sons<br />
And daughters, both, hail'd as their guardian God,<br />
Conscious of benefits from thee received,<br />
Whose life prolong'd should have advanced them all<br />
To high renown. Vain boast! thou art no more.<span class="lnm">505</span></p>
<p>  So mourn'd the Queen. But fair Andromache<br />
Nought yet had heard, nor knew by sure report<br />
Hector's delay without the city gates.<br />
She in a closet of her palace sat,<br />
A twofold web weaving magnificent,<span class="lnm">510</span><br />
With sprinkled flowers inwrought of various hues,<br />
And to her maidens had commandment given<br />
<span class="pgnm">550</span><a name="page_550" id="page_550"></a>
Through all her house, that compassing with fire<br />
An ample tripod, they should warm a bath<br />
For noble Hector from the fight return'd.<span class="lnm">515</span><br />
Tenderness ill-inform'd! she little knew<br />
That in the field, from such refreshments far,<br />
Pallas had slain him by Achilles' hand.<br />
She heard a cry of sorrow from the tower;<br />
Her limbs shook under her, her shuttle fell,<span class="lnm">520</span><br />
And to her bright-hair'd train, alarm'd, she cried.</p>
<p>  Attend me two of you, that I may learn<br />
What hath befallen. I have heard the voice<br />
Of the Queen-mother; my rebounding heart<br />
Chokes me, and I seem fetter'd by a frost.<span class="lnm">525</span><br />
Some mischief sure o'er Priam's sons impends.<br />
Far be such tidings from me! but I fear<br />
Horribly, lest Achilles, cutting off<br />
My dauntless Hector from the gates alone,<br />
Enforce him to the field, and quell perhaps<span class="lnm">530</span><br />
The might, this moment, of that dreadful arm<br />
His hinderance long; for Hector ne'er was wont<br />
To seek his safety in the ranks, but flew<br />
First into battle, yielding place to none.</p>
<p>  So saying, she rush'd with palpitating heart<span class="lnm">535</span><br />
And frantic air abroad, by her two maids<br />
Attended; soon arriving at the tower,<br />
And at the throng of men, awhile she stood<br />
Down-looking wistful from the city-wall,<br />
And, seeing him in front of Ilium, dragg'd<span class="lnm">540</span><br />
So cruelly toward the fleet of Greece,<br />
O'erwhelm'd with sudden darkness at the view<br />
Fell backward, with a sigh heard all around.<br />
Far distant flew dispersed her head-attire,<br />
Twist, frontlet, diadem, and even the veil<span class="lnm">545</span><br />
By golden Venus given her on the day<br />
When Hector led her from E&euml;tion's house<br />
Enrich'd with nuptial presents to his home.<br />
Around her throng'd her sisters of the house<br />
Of Priam, numerous, who within their arms<span class="lnm">550</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">551</span><a name="page_551" id="page_551"></a>
Fast held her<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_22-16">[16]</a> loathing life; but she, her breath<br />
At length and sense recovering, her complaint<br />
Broken with sighs amid them thus began.</p>
<p>  Hector! I am undone; we both were born<br />
To misery, thou in Priam's house in Troy,<span class="lnm">555</span><br />
And I in Hypoplacian Thebes wood-crown'd<br />
Beneath E&euml;tion's roof. He, doom'd himself<br />
To sorrow, me more sorrowfully doom'd,<br />
Sustain'd in helpless infancy, whom oh<br />
That he had ne'er begotten! thou descend'st<span class="lnm">560</span><br />
To Pluto's subterraneous dwelling drear,<br />
Leaving myself destitute, and thy boy,<br />
Fruit of our hapless loves, an infant yet,<br />
Never to be hereafter thy delight,<br />
Nor love of thine to share or kindness more.<span class="lnm">565</span><br />
For should he safe survive this cruel war,<br />
With the Achaians penury and toil<br />
Must be his lot, since strangers will remove<br />
At will his landmarks, and possess his fields.<br />
Thee lost, he loses all, of father, both,<span class="lnm">570</span><br />
And equal playmate in one day deprived,<br />
To sad looks doom'd, and never-ceasing-tears.<br />
He seeks, necessitous his father's friends,<br />
One by his mantle pulls, one by his vest,<br />
Whose utmost pity yields to his parch'd lips<span class="lnm">575</span><br />
A thirst-provoking drop, and grudges more;<br />
Some happier child, as yet untaught to mourn<br />
A parent's loss, shoves rudely from the board<br />
My son, and, smiting him, reproachful cries&mdash;<br />
Away&mdash;thy father is no guest of ours&mdash;<span class="lnm">580</span><br />
Then, weeping, to his widow'd mother comes<br />
Astyanax, who on his father's lap<br />
Ate marrow only, once, and fat of lambs,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_22-17">[17]</a><br />
<span class="pgnm">552</span><a name="page_552" id="page_552"></a>
And when sleep took him, and his crying fit<br />
Had ceased, slept ever on the softest bed,<span class="lnm">585</span><br />
Warm in his nurse's arms, fed to his fill<br />
With delicacies, and his heart at rest.<br />
But now, Astyanax (so named in Troy<br />
For thy sake, guardian of her gates and towers)<br />
His father lost, must many a pang endure.<span class="lnm">590</span><br />
And as for thee, cast naked forth among<br />
Yon galleys, where no parent's eye of thine<br />
Shall find thee, when the dogs have torn thee once<br />
Till they are sated, worms shall eat thee next.<br />
Meantime, thy graceful raiment rich, prepared<span class="lnm">595</span><br />
By our own maidens, in thy palace lies;<br />
But I will burn it, burn it all, because<br />
Useless to thee, who never, so adorn'd,<br />
Shalt slumber more; yet every eye in Troy<br />
Shall see, how glorious once was thy attire.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_22-18">[18]</a><span class="lnm">600</span></p>
<p>  So, weeping, she; to whom the multitude<br />
Of Trojan dames responsive sigh'd around.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="noind">Such mourning was in Troy; meantime the Greeks<br />
Their galleys and the shores of Hellespont<br />
Regaining, each to his own ship retired.<br />
But not the Myrmidons; Achilles them<br />
Close rank'd in martial order still detain'd,<span class="lnm">5</span><br />
And thus his fellow-warriors brave address'd.</p>
<p>  Ye swift-horsed Myrmidons, associates dear!<br />
Release not from your chariots yet your steeds<br />
Firm-hoof'd, but steeds and chariots driving near,<br />
Bewail Patroclus, as the rites demand<span class="lnm">10</span><br />
Of burial; then, satiate with grief and tears,<br />
We will release our steeds, and take repast.</p>
<p>  He ended, and, himself leading the way,<br />
His numerous band all mourn'd at once the dead.<br />
Around the body thrice their glossy steeds,<span class="lnm">15</span><br />
Mourning they drove, while Thetis in their hearts<br />
The thirst of sorrow kindled; they with tears<br />
The sands bedew'd, with tears their radiant arms,<br />
Such deep regret of one so brave they felt.<br />
Then, placing on the bosom of his friend<span class="lnm">20</span><br />
His homicidal hands, Achilles thus<br />
The shade of his Patroclus, sad, bespake.</p>
<p>  Hail, oh Patroclus, even in Ades hail!<br />
For I will now accomplish to the full<br />
My promise pledged to thee, that I would give<span class="lnm">25</span><br />
Hector dragg'd hither to be torn by dogs<br />
<span class="pgnm">556</span><a name="page_556" id="page_556"></a>
Piecemeal, and would before thy funeral pile<br />
The necks dissever of twelve Trojan youths<br />
Of noblest rank, resentful of thy death.</p>
<p>  He said, and meditating foul disgrace<span class="lnm">30</span><br />
To noble Hector, stretch'd him prone in dust<br />
Beside the bier of Men&oelig;tiades.<br />
Then all the Myrmidons their radiant arms<br />
Put off, and their shrill-neighing steeds released.<br />
A numerous band beside the bark they sat<span class="lnm">35</span><br />
Of swift &AElig;acides, who furnish'd forth<br />
Himself a feast funereal for them all.<br />
Many a white ox under the ruthless steel<br />
Lay bleeding, many a sheep and blatant goat,<br />
With many a saginated boar bright-tusk'd,<span class="lnm">40</span><br />
Amid fierce flames Vulcanian stretch'd to roast.<br />
Copious the blood ran all around the dead.</p>
<p>  And now the Kings of Greece conducted thence<br />
To Agamemnon's tent the royal son<br />
Of Peleus, loth to go, and won at last<span class="lnm">45</span><br />
With difficulty, such his anger was<br />
And deep resentment of his slaughter'd friend.<br />
Soon then as Agamemnon's tent they reach'd,<br />
The sovereign bade his heralds kindle fire<br />
Around an ample vase, with purpose kind<span class="lnm">50</span><br />
Moving Achilles from his limbs to cleanse<br />
The stains of battle; but he firm refused<br />
That suit, and bound refusal with an oath&mdash;</p>
<p>  No; by the highest and the best of all,<br />
By Jove I will not. Never may it be<span class="lnm">55</span><br />
That brazen bath approach this head of mine,<br />
Till I shall first Patroclus' body give<br />
To his last fires, till I shall pile his tomb,<br />
And sheer my locks in honor of my friend;<br />
For, like to this, no second wo shall e'er<span class="lnm">60</span><br />
My heart invade, while vital breath I draw.<br />
But, all unwelcome as it is, repast<br />
Now calls us. Agamemnon, King of men!<br />
Give thou command that at the dawn they bring<br />
<span class="pgnm">557</span><a name="page_557" id="page_557"></a>
Wood hither, such large portion as beseems<span class="lnm">65</span><br />
The dead, descending to the shades, to share,<br />
That hungry flames consuming out of sight<br />
His body soon, the host may war again.</p>
<p>  He spake; they, hearing, readily obey'd.<br />
Then, each his food preparing with dispatch,<span class="lnm">70</span><br />
They ate, nor wanted any of the guests<br />
Due portion, and their appetites sufficed<br />
To food and wine, all to their tents repair'd<br />
Seeking repose; but on the sands beside<br />
The billowy deep Achilles groaning lay<span class="lnm">75</span><br />
Amidst his Myrmidons, where space he found<br />
With blood unstain'd beside the dashing wave.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_23-1">[1]</a><br />
There, soon as sleep, deliverer of the mind,<br />
Wrapp'd him around (for much his noble limbs<br />
With chase of Hector round the battlements<span class="lnm">80</span><br />
Of wind-swept Ilium wearied were and spent)<br />
The soul came to him of his hapless friend,<br />
In bulk resembling, in expressive eyes<br />
And voice Patroclus, and so clad as he.<br />
Him, hovering o'er his head, the form address'd.<span class="lnm">85</span></p>
<p>  Sleep'st thou, Achilles! of thy friend become<br />
Heedless? Him living thou didst not neglect<br />
Whom thou neglectest dead. Give me a tomb<br />
Instant, that I may pass the infernal gates.<br />
For now, the shades and spirits of the dead<span class="lnm">90</span><br />
Drive me afar, denying me my wish<br />
To mingle with them on the farthest shore,<br />
And in wide-portal'd Ades sole I roam.<br />
Give me thine hand, I pray thee, for the earth<br />
I visit never more, once burnt with fire;<span class="lnm">95</span><br />
We never shall again close council hold<br />
As we were wont, for me my fate severe,<br />
Mine even from my birth, hath deep absorb'd.<br />
And oh Achilles, semblance of the Gods!<br />
Thou too predestined art beneath the wall<span class="lnm">100</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">558</span><a name="page_558" id="page_558"></a>
To perish of the high-born Trojan race.<br />
But hear my last injunction! ah, my friend!<br />
My bones sepulchre not from thine apart,<br />
But as, together we were nourish'd both<br />
Beneath thy roof (what time from Opo&euml;is<span class="lnm">105</span><br />
Men&oelig;tius led me to thy father's house,<br />
Although a child, yet fugitive for blood,<br />
Which, in a quarrel at the dice, I spilt,<br />
Killing my playmate by a casual blow,<br />
The offspring of Amphidamas, when, like<span class="lnm">110</span><br />
A father, Peleus with all tenderness<br />
Received and cherish'd me, and call'd me thine)<br />
So, let one vase inclose, at last, our bones,<br />
The golden vase, thy Goddess mother's gift.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_23-2">[2]</a></p>
<p>  To whom Achilles, matchless in the race.<span class="lnm">115</span><br />
Ah, loved and honor'd! wherefore hast thou come!<br />
Why thus enjoin'd me? I will all perform<br />
With diligence that thou hast now desired.<br />
But nearer stand, that we may mutual clasp<br />
Each other, though but with a short embrace,<span class="lnm">120</span><br />
And sad satiety of grief enjoy.</p>
<p>  He said, and stretch'd his arms toward the shade,<br />
But him seized not; shrill-clamoring and light<br />
As smoke, the spirit pass'd into the earth.<br />
Amazed, upsprang Achilles, clash'd aloud<span class="lnm">125</span><br />
His palms together, and thus, sad, exclaim'd.</p>
<p>  Ah then, ye Gods! there doubtless are below<br />
The soul and semblance both, but empty forms;<br />
For all night long, mourning, disconsolate,<br />
The soul of my Patroclus, hapless friend!<span class="lnm">130</span><br />
Hath hover'd o'er me, giving me in charge<br />
His last requests, just image of himself.</p>
<p>  So saying, he call'd anew their sorrow forth,<br />
<span class="pgnm">559</span><a name="page_559" id="page_559"></a>
And rosy-palm'd Aurora found them all<br />
Mourning afresh the pitiable dead.<span class="lnm">135</span><br />
Then royal Agamemnon call'd abroad<br />
Mules and mule-drivers from the tents in haste<br />
To gather wood. Uprose a valiant man,<br />
Friend of the virtuous Chief Idomeneus,<br />
Meriones, who led them to the task.<span class="lnm">140</span><br />
They, bearing each in hand his sharpen'd axe<br />
And twisted cord, thence journey'd forth, the mules<br />
Driving before them; much uneven space<br />
They measured, hill and dale, right onward now,<br />
And now circuitous; but at the groves<span class="lnm">145</span><br />
Arrived at length, of Ida fountain-fed,<br />
Their keen-edged axes to the towering oaks<br />
Dispatchful they applied; down fell the trees<br />
With crash sonorous. Splitting, next, the trunks,<br />
They bound them on the mules; they, with firm hoofs<span class="lnm">150</span><br />
The hill-side stamping, through the thickets rush'd<br />
Desirous of the plain. Each man his log<br />
(For so the armor-bearer of the King<br />
Of Crete, Meriones, had them enjoin'd)<br />
Bore after them, and each his burthen cast<span class="lnm">155</span><br />
Down on the beach regular, where a tomb<br />
Of ample size Achilles for his friend<br />
Patroclus had, and for himself, design'd.</p>
<p>  Much fuel thrown together, side by side<br />
There down they sat, and his command at once<span class="lnm">160</span><br />
Achilles issued to his warriors bold,<br />
That all should gird their armor, and the steeds<br />
Join to their chariots; undelaying each<br />
Complied, and in bright arms stood soon array'd.<br />
Then mounted combatants and charioteers.<span class="lnm">165</span><br />
First, moved the chariots, next, the infantry<br />
Proceeded numerous, amid whom his friends,<br />
Bearing the body of Patroclus, went.<br />
They poll'd their heads, and cover'd him with hair<br />
Shower'd over all his body, while behind<span class="lnm">170</span><br />
Noble Achilles march'd, the hero's head<br />
<span class="pgnm">560</span><a name="page_560" id="page_560"></a>
Sustaining sorrowful, for to the realms<br />
Of Ades a distinguish'd friend he sent.</p>
<p>  And now, arriving on the ground erewhile<br />
Mark'd by Achilles, setting down the dead,<span class="lnm">175</span><br />
They heap'd the fuel quick, a lofty pile.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_23-3">[3]</a><br />
But Peleus' son, on other thoughts intent,<br />
Retiring from the funeral pile, shore off<br />
His amber ringlets,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_23-4">[4]</a> whose exuberant growth<br />
Sacred to Sperchius he had kept unshorn,<span class="lnm">180</span><br />
And looking o'er the gloomy deep, he said.</p>
<p>  Sperchius! in vain Peleus my father vow'd<br />
That, hence returning to my native land,<br />
These ringlets shorn I should present to thee<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_23-5">[5]</a><br />
With a whole hecatomb, and should, beside,<span class="lnm">185</span><br />
Rams offer fifty at thy fountain head<br />
In thy own field, at thy own fragrant shrine.<br />
So vow'd the hoary Chief, whose wishes thou<br />
Leavest unperform'd. Since, therefore, never more<br />
I see my native home, the hero these<span class="lnm">190</span><br />
Patroclus takes down with him to the shades.</p>
<p>  He said, and filling with his hair the hand<br />
Of his dead friend, the sorrows of his train<br />
Waken'd afresh. And now the lamp of day<br />
Westering<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_23-6">[6]</a> apace, had left them still in tears,<span class="lnm">195</span><br />
Had not Achilles suddenly address'd<br />
King Agamemnon, standing at his side.</p>
<p>  Atrides! (for Achaia's sons thy word<br />
Will readiest execute) we may with grief<br />
Satiate ourselves hereafter; but, the host<span class="lnm">200</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">561</span><a name="page_561" id="page_561"></a>
Dispersing from the pile, now give command<br />
That they prepare repast; ourselves,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_23-7">[7]</a> to whom<br />
These labors in peculiar appertain<br />
Will finish them; but bid the Chiefs abide.</p>
<p>  Which when imperial Agamemnon heard,<span class="lnm">205</span><br />
He scatter'd instant to their several ships<br />
The people; but the burial-dressers thence<br />
Went not; they, still abiding, heap'd the pile.<br />
A hundred feet of breadth from side to side<br />
They gave to it, and on the summit placed<span class="lnm">210</span><br />
With sorrowing hearts the body of the dead.<br />
Many a fat sheep, with many an ox full-horn'd<br />
They flay'd before the pile, busy their task<br />
Administering, and Peleus' son the fat<br />
Taking from every victim, overspread<span class="lnm">215</span><br />
Complete the body with it of his friend<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_23-8">[8]</a><br />
Patroclus, and the flay'd beasts heap'd around.<br />
Then, placing flagons on the pile, replete<br />
With oil and honey, he inclined their mouths<br />
Toward the bier, and slew and added next,<span class="lnm">220</span><br />
Deep-groaning and in haste, four martial steeds.<br />
Nine dogs the hero at his table fed,<br />
Of which beheading two, their carcases<br />
He added also. Last, twelve gallant sons<br />
Of noble Trojans slaying (for his heart<span class="lnm">225</span><br />
Teem'd with great vengeance) he applied the force<br />
Of hungry flames that should devour the whole,<br />
Then, mourning loud, by name his friend invoked.</p>
<p>  Rejoice, Patroclus! even in the shades,<br />
Behold my promise to thee all fulfill'd!<span class="lnm">230</span><br />
Twelve gallant sons of Trojans famed in arms,<br />
Together with thyself, are all become<br />
Food for these fires: but fire shall never feed<br />
On Hector; him I destine to the dogs.</p>
<p>  So threaten'd he; but him no dogs devour'd;<span class="lnm">235</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">562</span><a name="page_562" id="page_562"></a>
Them, day and night, Jove's daughter Venus chased<br />
Afar, and smooth'd the hero o'er with oils<br />
Of rosy scent ambrosial, lest his corse,<br />
Behind Achilles' chariot dragg'd along<br />
So rudely, should be torn; and Ph&oelig;bus hung<span class="lnm">240</span><br />
A veil of sable clouds from heaven to earth,<br />
O'ershadowing broad the space where Hector lay,<br />
Lest parching suns intense should stiffen him.</p>
<p>  But the pile kindled not. Then, Peleus' son<br />
Seeking a place apart, two Winds in prayer<span class="lnm">245</span><br />
Boreas invoked and Zephyrus, to each<br />
Vowing large sacrifice. With earnest suit<br />
(Libation pouring from a golden cup)<br />
Their coming he implored, that so the flames<br />
Kindling, incontinent might burn the dead.<span class="lnm">250</span><br />
Iris, his supplications hearing, swift<br />
Convey'd them to the Winds; they, in the hall<br />
Banqueting of the heavy-blowing West<br />
Sat frequent. Iris, sudden at the gate<br />
Appear'd; they, at the sight upstarting all,<span class="lnm">255</span><br />
Invited each the Goddess to himself.<br />
But she refused a seat and thus she spake.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_23-9">[9]</a></p>
<p>  I sit not here. Borne over Ocean's stream<br />
Again, to &AElig;thiopia's land I go<br />
Where hecatombs are offer'd to the Gods,<span class="lnm">260</span><br />
Which, with the rest, I also wish to share.<br />
But Peleus' son, earnest, the aid implores<br />
Of Boreas and of Zephyrus the loud,<br />
Vowing large sacrifice if ye will fan<br />
Briskly the pile on which Patroclus lies<span class="lnm">265</span><br />
By all Achaia's warriors deep deplored.</p>
<p>  She said, and went. Then suddenly arose<br />
The Winds, and, roaring, swept the clouds along.<br />
First, on the sea they blew; big rose the waves<br />
Beneath the blast. At fruitful Troy arrived<span class="lnm">270</span><br />
Vehement on the pile they fell, and dread<br />
<span class="pgnm">563</span><a name="page_563" id="page_563"></a>
On all sides soon a crackling blaze ensued.<br />
All night, together blowing shrill, they drove<br />
The sheeted flames wide from the funeral pile,<br />
And all night long, a goblet in his hand<span class="lnm">275</span><br />
From golden beakers fill'd, Achilles stood<br />
With large libations soaking deep the soil,<br />
And calling on the spirit of his friend.<br />
As some fond father mourns, burning the bones<br />
Of his own son, who, dying on the eve<span class="lnm">280</span><br />
Of his glad nuptials, hath his parents left<br />
O'erwhelm'd with inconsolable distress,<br />
So mourn'd Achilles, his companion's bones<br />
Burning, and pacing to and fro the field<br />
Beside the pile with many a sigh profound.<span class="lnm">285</span><br />
But when the star, day's harbinger, arose,<br />
Soon after whom, in saffron vest attired<br />
The morn her beams diffuses o'er the sea,<br />
The pile, then wasted, ceased to flame, and then<br />
Back flew the Winds over the Thracian deep<span class="lnm">290</span><br />
Rolling the flood before them as they pass'd.<br />
And now Pelides lying down apart<br />
From the funereal pile, slept, but not long,<br />
Though weary; waken'd by the stir and din<br />
Of Agamemnon's train. He sat erect,<span class="lnm">295</span><br />
And thus the leaders of the host address'd.</p>
<p>  Atrides, and ye potentates who rule<br />
The whole Achaian host! first quench the pile<br />
Throughout with generous wine, where'er the fire<br />
Hath seized it. We will then the bones collect<span class="lnm">300</span><br />
Of Men&oelig;tiades, which shall with ease<br />
Be known, though many bones lie scatter'd near,<br />
Since in the middle pile Patroclus lay,<br />
But wide apart and on its verge we burn'd<br />
The steeds and Trojans, a promiscuous heap.<span class="lnm">305</span><br />
Them so collected in a golden vase<br />
We will dispose, lined with a double cawl,<br />
Till I shall, also, to my home below.<br />
I wish not now a tomb of amplest bounds,<br />
<span class="pgnm">564</span><a name="page_564" id="page_564"></a>
But such as may suffice, which yet in height<span class="lnm">310</span><br />
The Grecians and in breadth shall much augment<br />
Hereafter, who, survivors of my fate,<br />
Shall still remain in the Achaian fleet.</p>
<p>  So spake Pelides, and the Chiefs complied.<br />
Where'er the pile had blazed, with generous wine<span class="lnm">315</span><br />
They quench'd it, and the hills of ashes sank.<br />
Then, weeping, to a golden vase, with lard<br />
Twice lined, they gave their gentle comrade's bones<br />
Fire-bleach'd, and lodging safely in his tent<br />
The relics, overspread them with a veil.<span class="lnm">320</span><br />
Designing, next, the compass of the tomb,<br />
They mark'd its boundary with stones, then fill'd<br />
The wide enclosure hastily with earth,<br />
And, having heap'd it to its height, return'd.<br />
But all the people, by Achilles still<span class="lnm">325</span><br />
Detain'd, there sitting, form'd a spacious ring,<br />
And he the destined prizes from his fleet<br />
Produced, capacious caldrons, tripods bright,<br />
Steeds, mules, tall oxen, women at the breast<br />
Close-cinctured, elegant, and unwrought<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_23-10">[10]</a> iron.<span class="lnm">330</span><br />
First, to the chariot-drivers he proposed<br />
A noble prize; a beauteous maiden versed<br />
In arts domestic, with a tripod ear'd,<br />
Of twenty and two measures. These he made<br />
The conqueror's meed. The second should a mare<span class="lnm">335</span><br />
Obtain, unbroken yet, six years her age,<br />
Pregnant, and bearing in her womb a mule.<br />
A caldron of four measures, never smirch'd<br />
By smoke or flame, but fresh as from the forge<br />
The third awaited; to the fourth he gave<span class="lnm">340</span><br />
Two golden talents, and, unsullied yet<br />
By use, a twin-ear'd phial<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_23-11">[11]</a> to the fifth.<br />
He stood erect, and to the Greeks he cried.</p>
<p><span class="pgnm">565</span><a name="page_565" id="page_565"></a>
  Atrides, and ye chiefs of all the host!<br />
These prizes, in the circus placed, attend<span class="lnm">345</span><br />
The charioteers. Held we the present games<br />
In honor of some other Grecian dead,<br />
I would myself bear hence the foremost prize;<br />
For ye are all witnesses well-inform'd<br />
Of the superior virtue of my steeds.<span class="lnm">350</span><br />
They are immortal; Neptune on my sire<br />
Peleus conferr'd them, and my sire on me.<br />
But neither I this contest share myself,<br />
Nor shall my steeds; for they would miss the force<br />
And guidance of a charioteer so kind<span class="lnm">355</span><br />
As they have lost, who many a time hath cleansed<br />
Their manes with water of the crystal brook,<br />
And made them sleek, himself, with limpid oil.<br />
Him, therefore, mourning, motionless they stand<br />
With hair dishevell'd, streaming to the ground.<span class="lnm">360</span><br />
But ye, whoever of the host profess<br />
Superior skill, and glory in your steeds<br />
And well-built chariots, for the strife prepare!</p>
<p>  So spake Pelides, and the charioteers,<br />
For speed renown'd arose. Long ere the rest<span class="lnm">365</span><br />
Eumelus, King of men, Admetus' son<br />
Arose, accomplish'd in equestrian arts.<br />
Next, Tydeus' son, brave Diomede, arose;<br />
He yoked the Trojan coursers by himself<br />
In battle from &AElig;neas won, what time<span class="lnm">370</span><br />
Apollo saved their master. Third, upstood<br />
The son of Atreus with the golden locks,<br />
Who to his chariot Agamemnon's mare<br />
Swift &AElig;the and his own Podargus join'd.<br />
Her Echepolus from Anchises sprung<span class="lnm">375</span><br />
To Agamemnon gave; she was the price<br />
At which he purchased leave to dwell at home<br />
Excused attendance on the King at Troy;<br />
For, by the gift of Jove, he had acquired<br />
Great riches, and in wide-spread Sicyon dwelt.<span class="lnm">380</span><br />
Her wing'd with ardor, Menelaus yoked.<br />
<span class="pgnm">566</span><a name="page_566" id="page_566"></a>
Antilochus, arising fourth, his steeds<br />
Bright-maned prepared, son of the valiant King<br />
Of Pylus, Nestor Nele&iuml;ades.<br />
Of Pylian breed were they, and thus his sire,<span class="lnm">385</span><br />
With kind intent approaching to his side,<br />
Advised him, of himself not uninform'd.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_23-12">[12]</a></p>
<p>  Antilochus! Thou art, I know, beloved<br />
By Jove and Neptune both, from whom, though young<br />
Thou hast received knowledge of every art<span class="lnm">390</span><br />
Equestrian, and hast little need to learn.<br />
Thou know'st already how to trim the goal<br />
With nicest skill, yet wondrous slow of foot<br />
Thy coursers are, whence evil may ensue.<br />
But though their steeds be swifter, I account<span class="lnm">395</span><br />
Thee wise, at least, as they. Now is the time<br />
For counsel, furnish now thy mind with all<br />
Precaution, that the prize escape thee not.<br />
The feller of huge trees by skill prevails<br />
More than by strength; by skill the pilot guides<span class="lnm">400</span><br />
His flying bark rock'd by tempestuous winds,<br />
And more by skill than speed the race is won.<br />
But he who in his chariot and his steeds<br />
Trusts only, wanders here and wanders there<br />
Unsteady, while his coursers loosely rein'd<span class="lnm">405</span><br />
Roam wide the field; not so the charioteer<br />
Of sound intelligence; he though he drive<br />
Inferior steeds, looks ever to the goal<br />
Which close he clips, not ignorant to check<br />
His coursers at the first but with tight rein<span class="lnm">410</span><br />
Ruling his own, and watching those before.<br />
Now mark; I will describe so plain the goal<br />
That thou shalt know it surely. A dry stump<br />
Extant above the ground an ell in height<br />
Stands yonder; either oak it is, or pine<span class="lnm">415</span><br />
More likely, which the weather least impairs.<br />
<span class="pgnm">567</span><a name="page_567" id="page_567"></a>
Two stones, both white, flank it on either hand.<br />
The way is narrow there, but smooth the course<br />
On both sides. It is either, as I think,<br />
A monument of one long since deceased,<span class="lnm">420</span><br />
Or was, perchance, in ancient days design'd,<br />
As now by Peleus' mighty son, a goal.<br />
That mark in view, thy steeds and chariot push<br />
Near to it as thou may'st; then, in thy seat<br />
Inclining gently to the left, prick smart<span class="lnm">425</span><br />
Thy right-hand horse challenging him aloud,<br />
And give him rein; but let thy left-hand horse<br />
Bear on the goal so closely, that the nave<br />
And felly<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_23-13">[13]</a> of thy wheel may seem to meet.<br />
Yet fear to strike the stone, lest foul disgrace<span class="lnm">430</span><br />
Of broken chariot and of crippled steeds<br />
Ensue, and thou become the public jest.<br />
My boy beloved! use caution; for if once<br />
Thou turn the goal at speed, no man thenceforth<br />
Shall reach, or if he reach, shall pass thee by,<span class="lnm">435</span><br />
Although Arion in thy rear he drove<br />
Adrastus' rapid horse of race divine,<br />
Or those, Troy's boast, bred by Laomedon.</p>
<p>  So Nestor spake, inculcating with care<br />
On his son's mind these lessons in the art,<span class="lnm">440</span><br />
And to his place retiring, sat again.<br />
Meriones his coursers glossy-maned<br />
Made ready last. Then to his chariot-seat<br />
Each mounted, and the lots were thrown; himself<br />
Achilles shook them. First, forth leap'd the lot<span class="lnm">445</span><br />
Of Nestor's son Antilochus, after whom<br />
The King Eumelus took his destined place.<br />
The third was Menelaus spear-renown'd;<br />
Meriones the fourth; and last of all,<br />
Bravest of all, heroic Diomede<span class="lnm">450</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">568</span><a name="page_568" id="page_568"></a>
The son of Tydeus took his lot to drive.<br />
So ranged they stood; Achilles show'd the goal<br />
Far on the champain, nigh to which he placed<br />
The godlike Ph&oelig;nix servant of his sire,<br />
To mark the race and make a true report.<span class="lnm">455</span></p>
<p>  All raised the lash at once, and with the reins<br />
At once all smote their steeds, urging them on<br />
Vociferous; they, sudden, left the fleet<br />
Far, far behind them, scouring swift the plain.<br />
Dark, like a stormy cloud, uprose the dust<span class="lnm">460</span><br />
Their chests beneath, and scatter'd in the wind<br />
Their manes all floated; now the chariots swept<br />
The low declivity unseen, and now<br />
Emerging started into view; erect<br />
The drivers stood; emulous, every heart<span class="lnm">465</span><br />
Beat double; each encouraged loud his steeds;<br />
They, flying, fill'd with dust the darken'd air.<br />
But when returning to the hoary deep<br />
They ran their last career, then each display'd<br />
Brightest his charioteership, and the race<span class="lnm">470</span><br />
Lay stretch'd, at once, into its utmost speed.<br />
Then, soon the mares of Pheretiades<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_23-14">[14]</a><br />
Pass'd all, but Diomede behind him came,<br />
Borne by his unemasculated steeds<br />
Of Trojan pedigree; they not remote,<span class="lnm">475</span><br />
But close pursued him; and at every pace<br />
Seem'd entering both; the chariot at their head,<br />
For blowing warm into Eumelus' neck<br />
Behind, and on his shoulders broad, they went,<br />
And their chins rested on him as they flew.<span class="lnm">480</span><br />
Then had Tydides pass'd him, or had made<br />
Decision dubious, but Apollo struck,<br />
Resentful,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_23-15">[15]</a> from his hand the glittering scourge.<br />
Fast roll'd the tears indignant down his cheeks,<br />
For he beheld the mares with double speed,<span class="lnm">485</span><br />
Flying, and of the spur deprived, his own<br />
<span class="pgnm">569</span><a name="page_569" id="page_569"></a>
Retarded steeds continual thrown behind.<br />
But not unnoticed by Minerva pass'd<br />
The art by Ph&oelig;bus practised to impede<br />
The son of Tydeus, whom with winged haste<span class="lnm">490</span><br />
Following, she gave to him his scourge again,<br />
And with new force his lagging steeds inspired.<br />
Eumelus, next, the angry Goddess, swift<br />
Pursuing, snapt his yoke; wide flew the mares<br />
Asunder, and the pole fell to the ground.<span class="lnm">495</span><br />
Himself, roll'd from his seat, fast by the wheel<br />
With lacerated elbows, nostrils, mouth,<br />
And batter'd brows lay prone; sorrow his eyes<br />
Deluged, and disappointment chok'd his voice.<br />
Then, far outstripping all, Tydides push'd<span class="lnm">500</span><br />
His steeds beyond, which Pallas fill'd with power<br />
That she might make the glorious prize his own.<br />
Him follow'd Menelaus amber-hair'd,<br />
The son of Atreus, and his father's steeds<br />
Encouraging, thus spake Antilochus.<span class="lnm">505</span></p>
<p>  Away&mdash;now stretch ye forward to the goal.<br />
I bid you not to an unequal strife<br />
With those of Diomede, for Pallas them<br />
Quickens that he may conquer, and the Chief<br />
So far advanced makes competition vain.<span class="lnm">510</span><br />
But reach the son of Atreus, fly to reach<br />
His steeds, incontinent; ah, be not shamed<br />
For ever, foil'd by &AElig;the, by a mare!<br />
Why fall ye thus behind, my noblest steeds?<br />
I tell you both, and ye shall prove me true,<span class="lnm">515</span><br />
No favor shall ye find at Nestor's hands,<br />
My valiant sire, but he will thrust his spear<br />
Right through you, should we lose, for sloth of yours,<br />
Or by your negligence, the nobler prize.<br />
Haste then&mdash;pursue him&mdash;reach the royal Chief&mdash;<span class="lnm">520</span><br />
And how to pass him in yon narrow way<br />
Shall be my care, and not my care in vain.</p>
<p>  He ended; they, awhile, awed by his voice,<br />
With more exertion ran, and Nestor's son<br />
<span class="pgnm">570</span><a name="page_570" id="page_570"></a>
Now saw the hollow strait mark'd by his sire.<span class="lnm">525</span><br />
It was a chasm abrupt, where winter-floods,<br />
Wearing the soil, had gullied deep the way.<br />
Thither Atrides, anxious to avoid<br />
A clash of chariots drove, and thither drove<br />
Also, but somewhat devious from his track,<span class="lnm">530</span><br />
Antilochus. Then Menelaus fear'd,<br />
And with loud voice the son of Nestor hail'd.</p>
<p>  Antilochus, at what a madman's rate<br />
Drivest thou! stop&mdash;check thy steeds&mdash;the way is here<br />
Too strait, but widening soon, will give thee scope<span class="lnm">535</span><br />
To pass me by; beware, lest chariot close<br />
To chariot driven, thou maim thyself and me.</p>
<p>  He said; but still more rapid and the scourge<br />
Plying continual, as he had not heard,<br />
Antilochus came on. Far as the quoit<span class="lnm">540</span><br />
By some broad-shoulder'd youth for trial hurl'd<br />
Of manhood flies, so far Antilochus<br />
Shot forward; but the coursers fell behind<br />
Of Atreus' son, who now abated much<br />
By choice his driving, lest the steeds of both<span class="lnm">545</span><br />
Jostling, should overturn with sudden shock<br />
Both chariots, and themselves in dust be roll'd,<br />
Through hot ambition of the foremost prize.<br />
Him then the hero golden-hair'd reproved.</p>
<p>  Antilochus! the man lives not on earth<span class="lnm">550</span><br />
Like thee for love of mischief. Go, extoll'd<br />
For wisdom falsely by the sons of Greece.<br />
Yet, trust me, not without an oath, the prize<br />
Thus foully sought shall even now be thine.</p>
<p>  He said, and to his coursers call'd aloud.<span class="lnm">555</span><br />
Ah be not tardy; stand not sorrow-check'd;<br />
Their feet will fail them sooner far than yours,<br />
For years have pass'd since they had youth to boast.</p>
<p>  So he; and springing at his voice, his steeds<br />
Regain'd apace the vantage lost. Meantime<span class="lnm">560</span><br />
The Grecians, in full circus seated, mark'd<br />
The steeds; they flying, fill'd with dust the air.<br />
<span class="pgnm">571</span><a name="page_571" id="page_571"></a>
Then, ere the rest, Idomeneus discern'd<br />
The foremost pair; for, on a rising ground<br />
Exalted, he without the circus sat,<span class="lnm">565</span><br />
And hearing, though remote, the driver's voice<br />
Chiding his steeds, knew it, and knew beside<br />
The leader horse distinguish'd by his hue,<br />
Chestnut throughout, save that his forehead bore<br />
A splendid blazon white, round as the moon.<span class="lnm">570</span></p>
<p>  He stood erect, and to the Greeks he cried.<br />
Friends! Chiefs and senators of Argos' host!<br />
Discern I sole the steeds, or also ye?<br />
The horses, foremost now, to me appear<br />
Other than erst, and I descry at hand<span class="lnm">575</span><br />
A different charioteer; the mares of late<br />
Victorious, somewhere distant in the race<br />
Are hurt; I plainly saw them at the first<br />
Turning the goal, but see them now no more;<br />
And yet with eyes inquisitive I range<span class="lnm">580</span><br />
From side to side the whole broad plain of Troy.<br />
Either the charioteer hath slipp'd the reins,<br />
Or rounded not successfully the goal<br />
Through want of guidance. Thrown, as it should seem,<br />
Forth from his seat, he hath his chariot maim'd,<span class="lnm">585</span><br />
And his ungovern'd steeds have roam'd away.<br />
Arise and look ye forth yourselves, for I<br />
With doubtful ken behold him; yet the man<br />
Seems, in my view, &AElig;tolian by descent,<br />
A Chief of prime renown in Argos' host,<span class="lnm">590</span><br />
The hero Tydeus' son, brave Diomede,</p>
<p>  But Ajax O&iuml;liades the swift<br />
Him sharp reproved. Why art thou always given<br />
To prate, Idomeneus? thou seest the mares,<br />
Remote indeed, but posting to the goal.<span class="lnm">595</span><br />
Thou art not youngest of the Argives here<br />
So much, nor from beneath thy brows look forth<br />
Quick-sighted more than ours, thine eyes abroad.<br />
Yet still thou pratest, although silence more<br />
Should suit thee, among wiser far than thou.<span class="lnm">600</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">572</span><a name="page_572" id="page_572"></a>
The mares which led, lead still, and he who drives<br />
Eumelus is, the same who drove before.</p>
<p>  To whom the Cretan Chief, angry, replied.<br />
Ajax! whom none in wrangling can excel<br />
Or rudeness, though in all beside thou fall<span class="lnm">605</span><br />
Below the Argives, being boorish-rough,<br />
Come now&mdash;a tripod let us wager each,<br />
Or caldron, and let Agamemnon judge<br />
Whose horses lead, that, losing, thou may'st learn.</p>
<p>  He said; then sudden from his seat upsprang<span class="lnm">610</span><br />
Swift Ajax O&iuml;liades, prepared<br />
For harsh retort, nor had the contest ceased<br />
Between them, but had grown from ill to worse,<br />
Had not himself, Achilles, interposed.</p>
<p>  Ajax&mdash;Idomeneus&mdash;abstain ye both<span class="lnm">615</span><br />
From bitter speech offensive, and such terms<br />
As ill become you. Ye would feel, yourselves,<br />
Resentment, should another act as ye.<br />
Survey the course, peaceable, from your seats;<br />
The charioteers, by competition wing'd,<span class="lnm">620</span><br />
Will soon themselves arrive, then shall ye know<br />
Distinctly, both who follows and who leads.</p>
<p>  He scarce had said, when nigh at hand appear'd<br />
Tydides, lashing, as he came, his steeds<br />
Continual; they with hoofs uplifted high<span class="lnm">625</span><br />
Their yet remaining ground shorten'd apace,<br />
Sprinkling with dusty drops at every stroke<br />
Their charioteer, while close upon their heels<br />
Radiant with tin and gold the chariot ran,<br />
Scarce tracking light the dust, so swift they flew.<span class="lnm">630</span><br />
He stood in the mid-circus; there the sweat<br />
Rain'd under them from neck and chest profuse,<br />
And Diomede from his resplendent seat<br />
Leaping, reclined his scourge against the yoke.<br />
Nor was his friend brave Sthenelus remiss,<span class="lnm">635</span><br />
But, seizing with alacrity the prize,<br />
Consign'd the tripod and the virgin, first,<br />
To his own band in charge; then, loosed the steeds.<br />
<span class="pgnm">573</span><a name="page_573" id="page_573"></a>
Next came, by stratagem, not speed advanced<br />
To that distinction, Nestor's son, whom yet<span class="lnm">640</span><br />
The hero Menelaus close pursued<br />
Near as the wheel runs to a courser's heels,<br />
Drawing his master at full speed; his tail<br />
With its extremest hairs the felly sweeps<br />
That close attends him o'er the spacious plain,<span class="lnm">645</span><br />
So near had Menelaus now approach'd<br />
Antilochus; for though at first he fell<br />
A full quoit's cast behind, he soon retrieved<br />
That loss, with such increasing speed the mare<br />
Bright-maned of Agamemnon, &AElig;the, ran;<span class="lnm">650</span><br />
She, had the course few paces more to both<br />
Afforded, should have clearly shot beyond<br />
Antilochus, nor dubious left the prize.<br />
But noble Menelaus threw behind<br />
Meriones, companion in the field,<span class="lnm">655</span><br />
Of King Idomeneus, a lance's flight,<br />
For slowest were his steeds, and he, to rule<br />
The chariot in the race, least skill'd of all.<br />
Last came Eumelus drawing to the goal,<br />
Himself, his splendid chariot, and his mares<span class="lnm">660</span><br />
Driving before him. Peleus' rapid son<br />
Beheld him with compassion, and, amid<br />
The Argives, in wing'd accents thus he spake.</p>
<p>  Here comes the most expert, driving his steeds<br />
Before him. Just it were that he received<span class="lnm">665</span><br />
The second prize; Tydides claims the first.</p>
<p>  He said, and all applauded the award.<br />
Then had Achilles to Eumelus given<br />
The mare (for such the pleasure seem'd of all)<br />
Had not the son of mighty Nestor risen,<span class="lnm">670</span><br />
Antilochus, who pleaded thus his right.</p>
<p>  Achilles! acting as thou hast proposed,<br />
Thou shalt offend me much, for thou shalt take<br />
The prize from me, because the Gods, his steeds<br />
And chariot-yoke disabling, render'd vain<span class="lnm">675</span><br />
His efforts, and no failure of his own.<br />
<span class="pgnm">574</span><a name="page_574" id="page_574"></a>
It was his duty to have sought the Gods<br />
In prayer, then had he not, following on foot<br />
His coursers, hindmost of us all arrived.<br />
But if thou pity him, and deem it good,<span class="lnm">680</span><br />
Thou hast much gold, much brass, and many sheep<br />
In thy pavilion; thou hast maidens fair,<br />
And coursers also. Of thy proper stores<br />
Hereafter give to him a richer prize<br />
Than this, or give it now, so shall the Greeks<span class="lnm">685</span><br />
Applaud thee; but this mare yield I to none;<br />
Stand forth the Grecian who desires to win<br />
That recompense, and let him fight with me.</p>
<p>  He ended, and Achilles, godlike Chief,<br />
Smiled on him, gratulating his success,<span class="lnm">690</span><br />
Whom much he loved; then, ardent, thus replied.</p>
<p>  Antilochus! if thou wouldst wish me give<br />
Eumelus of my own, even so I will.<br />
I will present to him my corslet bright<br />
Won from Asterop&aelig;us, edged around<span class="lnm">695</span><br />
With glittering tin; a precious gift, and rare.</p>
<p>  So saying, he bade Automedon his friend<br />
Produce it from the tent; he at his word<br />
Departing, to Achilles brought the spoil,<br />
Which at his hands Eumelus glad received.<span class="lnm">700</span><br />
Then, stung with grief, and with resentment fired<br />
Immeasurable, Menelaus rose<br />
To charge Antilochus. His herald gave<br />
The sceptre to his hand, and (silence bidden<br />
To all) the godlike hero thus began.<span class="lnm">705</span></p>
<p>  Antilochus! oh heretofore discreet!<br />
What hast thou done? Thou hast dishonor'd foul<br />
My skill, and wrong'd my coursers, throwing thine,<br />
Although inferior far, by fraud before them.<br />
Ye Chiefs and Senators of Argos' host!<span class="lnm">710</span><br />
Impartial judge between us, lest, of these,<br />
Some say hereafter, Menelaus bore<br />
Antilochus by falsehood down, and led<br />
The mare away, because, although his steeds<br />
<span class="pgnm">575</span><a name="page_575" id="page_575"></a>
Were worse, his arm was mightier, and prevail'd.<span class="lnm">715</span><br />
Yet hold&mdash;myself will judge, and will to all<br />
Contentment give, for I will judge aright.<br />
Hither, Antilochus, illustrious youth!<br />
And, as the law prescribes, standing before<br />
Thy steeds and chariot, holding too the scourge<span class="lnm">720</span><br />
With which thou drovest, lay hand on both thy steeds,<br />
And swear by Neptune, circler of the earth,<br />
That neither wilfully, nor yet by fraud<br />
Thou didst impede my chariot in its course.</p>
<p>  Then prudent, thus Antilochus replied.<span class="lnm">725</span><br />
Oh royal Menelaus! patient bear<br />
The fault of one thy junior far, in years<br />
Alike unequal and in worth to thee.<br />
Thou know'st how rash is youth, and how propense<br />
To pass the bounds by decency prescribed,<span class="lnm">730</span><br />
Quick, but not wise. Lay, then, thy wrath aside;<br />
The mare now given me I will myself<br />
Deliver to thee, and if thou require<br />
A larger recompense, will rather yield<br />
A larger much than from thy favor fall<span class="lnm">735</span><br />
Deservedly for ever, mighty Prince!<br />
And sin so heinously against the Gods.</p>
<p>  So saying, the son of valiant Nestor led<br />
The mare, himself, to Menelaus' hand,<br />
Who with heart-freshening joy the prize received.<span class="lnm">740</span><br />
As on the ears of growing corn the dews<br />
Fall grateful, while the spiry grain erect<br />
Bristles the fields, so, Menelaus, felt<br />
Thy inmost soul a soothing pleasure sweet!<br />
Then answer thus the hero quick return'd.<span class="lnm">745</span></p>
<p>  Antilochus! exasperate though I were,<br />
Now, such no longer, I relinquish glad<br />
All strife with thee, for that at other times<br />
Thou never inconsiderate wast or light,<br />
Although by youthful heat misled to-day.<span class="lnm">750</span><br />
Yet safer is it not to over-reach<br />
Superiors, for no other Grecian here<br />
<span class="pgnm">576</span><a name="page_576" id="page_576"></a>
Had my extreme displeasure calm'd so soon;<br />
But thou hast suffer'd much, and much hast toil'd,<br />
As thy good father and thy brother have,<span class="lnm">755</span><br />
On my behalf; I, therefore, yield, subdued<br />
By thy entreaties, and the mare, though mine,<br />
Will also give thee, that these Grecians all<br />
May know me neither proud nor hard to appease.</p>
<p>  So saying, the mare he to No&euml;mon gave,<span class="lnm">760</span><br />
Friend of Antilochus, and, well-content,<br />
The polish'd caldron for <i>his</i> prize received.<br />
The fourth awarded lot (for he had fourth<br />
Arrived) Meriones asserted next,<br />
The golden talents; but the phial still<span class="lnm">765</span><br />
Left unappropriated Achilles bore<br />
Across the circus in his hand, a gift<br />
To ancient Nestor, whom he thus bespake.</p>
<p>  Thou also, oh my father! this accept,<br />
Which in remembrance of the funeral rites<span class="lnm">770</span><br />
Of my Patroclus, keep, for him thou seest<br />
Among the Greeks no more. Receive a prize,<br />
Thine by gratuity; for thou shalt wield<br />
The cestus, wrestle, at the spear contend,<br />
Or in the foot-race (fallen as thou art<span class="lnm">775</span><br />
Into the wane of life) never again.</p>
<p>  He said, and placed it in his hands. He, glad,<br />
Receiving it, in accents wing'd replied.</p>
<p>  True, oh my son! is all which thou hast spoken.<br />
These limbs, these hands, young friend! (their vigor lost)<span class="lnm">780</span><br />
No longer, darted from the shoulder, spring<br />
At once to battle. Ah that I could grow<br />
Young yet again, could feel again such force<br />
Athletic, as when in Buprasium erst<br />
The Epeans with sepulchral pomp entomb'd<span class="lnm">785</span><br />
King Amarynceus, where his sons ordain'd<br />
Funereal games in honor of their sire!<br />
Epean none or even Pylian there<br />
Could cope with me, or yet &AElig;tolian bold.<br />
Boxing, I vanquish'd Clytomedes, son<span class="lnm">790</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">577</span><a name="page_577" id="page_577"></a>
Of Enops; wrestling, the Pleuronian Chief<br />
Anc&aelig;us; in the foot-race Iphiclus,<br />
Though a fleet runner; and I over-pitch'd<br />
Phyleus and Polydorus at the spear.<br />
The sons of Actor<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_23-16">[16]</a> in the chariot-race<span class="lnm">795</span><br />
Alone surpass'd me, being two for one,<br />
And jealous both lest I should also win<br />
That prize, for to the victor charioteer<br />
They had assign'd the noblest prize of all.<br />
They were twin-brothers, and one ruled the steeds,<span class="lnm">800</span><br />
The steeds one ruled,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_23-17">[17]</a> the other lash'd them on.<br />
Such once was I; but now, these sports I leave<br />
To younger; me submission most befits<br />
To withering age, who then outshone the best.<br />
But go. The funeral of thy friend with games<span class="lnm">805</span><br />
Proceed to celebrate; I accept thy gift<br />
With pleasure; and my heart is also glad<br />
That thou art mindful evermore of one<br />
Who loves thee, and such honor in the sight<br />
Yield'st me of all the Greeks, as is my due.<span class="lnm">810</span><br />
May the Gods bless thee for it more and more!</p>
<p>  He spake, and Peleus' son, when he had heard<br />
At large his commendation from the lips<br />
Of Nestor, through the assembled Greeks return'd.<br />
He next proposed, not lightly to be won,<span class="lnm">815</span><br />
The boxer's prize. He tether'd down a mule,<br />
Untamed and hard to tame, but strong to toil,<br />
And in her prime of vigor, in the midst;<br />
A goblet to the vanquish'd he assign'd,<br />
Then stood erect and to the Greeks exclaim'd.<span class="lnm">820</span></p>
<p>  Atrid&aelig;! and ye Argives brazen-greaved!<br />
I call for two bold combatants expert<br />
To wage fierce strife for these, with lifted fists<br />
<span class="pgnm">578</span><a name="page_578" id="page_578"></a>
Smiting each other. He, who by the aid<br />
Of Ph&oelig;bus shall o'ertome, and whom the Greeks<span class="lnm">825</span><br />
Shall all pronounce victorious, leads the mule<br />
Hence to his tent; the vanquish'd takes the cup.</p>
<p>  He spake, and at his word a Greek arose<br />
Big, bold, and skillful in the boxer's art,<br />
Epe&uuml;s, son of Panopeus; his hand<span class="lnm">830</span><br />
He on the mule imposed, and thus he said.</p>
<p>  Approach the man ambitious of the cup!<br />
For no Achaian here shall with his fist<br />
Me foiling, win the mule. I boast myself<br />
To all superior. May it not suffice<span class="lnm">835</span><br />
That I to no pre-eminence pretend<br />
In battle? To attain to foremost praise<br />
Alike in every art is not for one.<br />
But this I promise, and will well perform&mdash;<br />
My blows shall lay him open, split him, crush<span class="lnm">840</span><br />
His bones to splinters, and let all his friends,<br />
Attendant on him, wait to bear him hence,<br />
Vanquish'd by my superior force in fight.</p>
<p>  He ended, and his speech found no reply.<br />
One godlike Chief alone, Euryalus,<span class="lnm">845</span><br />
Son of the King Mecisteus, who, himself,<br />
Sprang from Talaion, opposite arose.<br />
He, on the death of Oedipus, at Thebes<br />
Contending in the games held at his tomb,<br />
Had overcome the whole Cadmean race.<span class="lnm">850</span><br />
Him Diomede spear-famed for fight prepared,<br />
Giving him all encouragement, for much<br />
He wish'd him victory. First then he threw<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_23-18">[18]</a><br />
His cincture to him; next, he gave him thongs<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_23-19">[19]</a><br />
Cut from the hide of a wild buffalo.<span class="lnm">855</span><br />
Both girt around, into the midst they moved.<br />
Then, lifting high their brawny arms, and fists<br />
Mingling with fists, to furious fight they fell;<br />
Dire was the crash of jaws, and the sweat stream'd<br />
<span class="pgnm">579</span><a name="page_579" id="page_579"></a>
From every limb. Epe&uuml;s fierce advanced,<span class="lnm">860</span><br />
And while Euryalus with cautious eye<br />
Watch'd his advantage, pash'd him on the cheek<br />
He stood no longer, but, his shapely limbs,<br />
Unequal to his weight, sinking, he fell.<br />
As by the rising north-wind driven ashore<span class="lnm">865</span><br />
A huge fish flounces on the weedy beach,<br />
Which soon the sable flood covers again,<br />
So, beaten down, he bounded. But Epe&uuml;s,<br />
Heroic chief, upraised him by his hand,<br />
And his own comrades from the circus forth<span class="lnm">870</span><br />
Led him, step dragging after step, the blood<br />
Ejecting grumous, and at every pace<br />
Rolling his head languid from side to side.<br />
They placed him all unconscious on his seat<br />
In his own band, then fetch'd his prize, the cup.<span class="lnm">875</span></p>
<p>  Still other prizes, then, Achilles placed<br />
In view of all, the sturdy wrestler's meed.<br />
A large hearth-tripod, valued by the Greeks<br />
At twice six beeves, should pay the victor's toil;<br />
But for the vanquish'd, in the midst he set<span class="lnm">880</span><br />
A damsel in variety expert<br />
Of arts domestic, valued at four beeves.<br />
He rose erect, and to the Greeks he cried.</p>
<p>  Arise ye, now, who shall this prize dispute.<br />
So spake the son of Peleus; then arose<span class="lnm">885</span><br />
Huge Telamonian Ajax, and upstood<br />
Ulysses also, in all wiles adept.<br />
Both girt around, into the midst they moved.<br />
With vigorous gripe each lock'd the other fast,<br />
Like rafters, standing, of some mansion built<span class="lnm">890</span><br />
By a prime artist proof against all winds.<br />
Their backs, tugg'd vehemently, creak'd,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_23-20">[20]</a> the sweat<br />
Trickled, and on their flanks and shoulders, red<br />
The whelks arose; they bearing still in mind<br />
<span class="pgnm">580</span><a name="page_580" id="page_580"></a>
The tripod, ceased not struggling for the prize.<span class="lnm">895</span><br />
Nor could Ulysses from his station move<br />
And cast down Ajax, nor could Ajax him<br />
Unsettle, fixt so firm Ulysses stood.<br />
But when, long time expectant, all the Greeks<br />
Grew weary, then, huge Ajax him bespake.<span class="lnm">900</span></p>
<p>  Laertes' noble son, for wiles renown'd!<br />
Lift, or be lifted, and let Jove decide.</p>
<p>  He said, and heaved Ulysses. Then, his wiles<br />
Forgat not he, but on the ham behind<br />
Chopp'd him; the limbs of Ajax at the stroke<span class="lnm">905</span><br />
Disabled sank; he fell supine, and bore<br />
Ulysses close adhering to his chest<br />
Down with him. Wonder riveted all eyes.<br />
Then brave Ulysses from the ground awhile<br />
Him lifted in his turn, but ere he stood,<span class="lnm">910</span><br />
Inserting his own knee the knees between<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_23-21">[21]</a><br />
Of Ajax, threw him. To the earth they fell<br />
Both, and with dust defiled lay side by side.<br />
And now, arising to a third essay,<br />
They should have wrestled yet again, had not<span class="lnm">915</span><br />
Achilles, interfering, them restrain'd.</p>
<p>  Strive not together more; cease to exhaust<br />
Each other's force; ye both have earn'd the prize<br />
Depart alike requited, and give place<br />
To other Grecians who shall next contend.<span class="lnm">920</span></p>
<p>  He spake; they glad complied, and wiping off<br />
The dust, put on their tunics. Then again<br />
Achilles other prizes yet proposed,<br />
The rapid runner's meed. First, he produced<br />
A silver goblet of six measures; earth<span class="lnm">925</span><br />
Own'd not its like for elegance of form.<br />
Skilful Sidonian artists had around<br />
Embellish'd it,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_23-22">[22]</a> and o'er the sable deep<br />
<span class="pgnm">581</span><a name="page_581" id="page_581"></a>
Ph&oelig;nician merchants into Lemnos' port<br />
Had borne it, and the boon to Thoas<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_23-23">[23]</a> given;<span class="lnm">930</span><br />
But Jason's son, Eune&uuml;s, in exchange<br />
For Priam's son Lycaon, to the hand<br />
Had pass'd it of Patroclus famed in arms.<br />
Achilles this, in honor of his friend,<br />
Set forth, the swiftest runner's recompense.<span class="lnm">935</span><br />
The second should a fatted ox receive<br />
Of largest size, and he assign'd of gold<br />
A just half-talent to the worst and last.<br />
He stood erect, and to the Greeks he cried.</p>
<p>  Now stand ye forth who shall this prize dispute.<span class="lnm">940</span><br />
He said, and at his word instant arose<br />
Swift Ajax O&iuml;liades; upsprang<br />
The shrewd Ulysses next, and after him<br />
Brave Nestor's son Antilochus, with whom<br />
None vied in speed of all the youths of Greece.<span class="lnm">945</span><br />
They stood prepared. Achilles show'd the goal.<br />
At once all started. O&iuml;liades<br />
Led swift the course, and closely at his heels<br />
Ulysses ran. Near as some cinctured maid<br />
Industrious holds the distaff to her breast,<span class="lnm">950</span><br />
While to and fro with practised finger neat<br />
She tends the flax drawing it to a thread,<br />
So near Ulysses follow'd him, and press'd<br />
His footsteps, ere the dust fill'd them again,<br />
Pouring his breath into his neck behind,<span class="lnm">955</span><br />
And never slackening pace. His ardent thirst<br />
Of victory with universal shouts<br />
All seconded, and, eager, bade him on.<br />
And now the contest shortening to a close,<br />
Ulysses his request silent and brief<span class="lnm">960</span><br />
To azure-eyed Minerva thus preferr'd.</p>
<p>  Oh Goddess hear, prosper me in the race!<br />
Such was his prayer, with which Minerva pleased,<br />
Freshen'd his limbs, and made him light to run.<br />
<span class="pgnm">582</span><a name="page_582" id="page_582"></a>
And now, when in one moment they should both<span class="lnm">965</span><br />
Have darted on the prize, then Ajax' foot<br />
Sliding, he fell; for where the dung of beeves<br />
Slain by Achilles for his friend, had spread<br />
The soil, there<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_23-24">[24]</a> Pallas tripp'd him. Ordure foul<br />
His mouth, and ordure foul his nostrils fill'd.<span class="lnm">970</span><br />
Then brave Ulysses, first arriving, seized<br />
The cup, and Ajax took his prize, the ox.<br />
He grasp'd his horn, and sputtering as he stood<br />
The ordure forth, the Argives thus bespake.</p>
<p>  Ah&mdash;Pallas tripp'd my footsteps; she attends<span class="lnm">975</span><br />
Ulysses ever with a mother's care.</p>
<p>  Loud laugh'd the Grecians. Then, the remnant prize<br />
Antilochus receiving, smiled and said.</p>
<p>  Ye need not, fellow-warriors, to be taught<br />
That now, as ever, the immortal Gods<span class="lnm">980</span><br />
Honor on seniority bestow.<br />
Ajax is elder, yet not much, than I.<br />
But Laertiades was born in times<br />
Long past, a chief co&euml;val with our sires,<br />
Not young, but vigorous; and of the Greeks,<span class="lnm">985</span><br />
Achilles may alone with him contend.</p>
<p>  So saying, the merit of superior speed<br />
To Peleus' son he gave, who thus replied.</p>
<p>  Antilochus! thy praise of me shall prove<br />
Nor vain nor unproductive to thyself,<span class="lnm">990</span><br />
For the half-talent doubled shall be thine.</p>
<p>  He spake, and, doubling it, the talent placed<br />
Whole in his hand. He glad the gift received.<br />
Achilles, then Sarpedon's arms produced,<br />
Stripp'd from him by Patroclus, his long spear,<span class="lnm">995</span><br />
Helmet and shield, which in the midst he placed.<br />
He stood erect, and to the Greeks he cried.</p>
<p>  I call for two brave warriors arm'd to prove<br />
Each other's skill with weapons keen, this prize<br />
Disputing, next, in presence of us all.<span class="lnm">1000</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">583</span><a name="page_583" id="page_583"></a>
Who first shall through his armor reach the skin<br />
Of his antagonist, and shall draw his blood,<br />
To him this silver-studded falchion bright<br />
I give; the blade is Thracian, and of late<br />
Asterop&aelig;us wore it, whom I slew.<span class="lnm">1005</span><br />
These other arms shall be their common meed,<br />
And I will banquet both within my tent.</p>
<p>  He said, then Telamonian Ajax huge<br />
Arose, and opposite the son arose<br />
Of warlike Tydeus, Diomede the brave.<span class="lnm">1010</span><br />
Apart from all the people each put on<br />
His arms, then moved into the middle space,<br />
Lowering terrific, and on fire to fight.<br />
The host look'd on amazed. Approaching each<br />
The other, thrice they sprang to the assault,<span class="lnm">1015</span><br />
And thrice struck hand to hand. Ajax the shield<br />
Pierced of his adversary, but the flesh<br />
Attain'd not, baffled by his mail within.<br />
Then Tydeus' son, sheer o'er the ample disk<br />
Of Ajax, thrust a lance home to his neck,<span class="lnm">1020</span><br />
And the Achaians for the life appall'd<br />
Of Ajax, bade them, ceasing, share the prize.<br />
But the huge falchion with its sheath and belt&mdash;<br />
Achilles them on Diomede bestow'd.</p>
<p>  The hero, next, an iron clod produced<span class="lnm">1025</span><br />
Rough from the forge, and wont to task the might<br />
Of King E&euml;tion; but, when him he slew,<br />
Pelides, glorious chief, with other spoils<br />
From Thebes convey'd it in his fleet to Troy.<br />
He stood erect, and to the Greeks he cried.<span class="lnm">1030</span></p>
<p>  Come forth who also shall this prize dispute!<br />
How far soe'er remote the winner's fields,<br />
This lump shall serve his wants five circling years;<br />
His shepherd shall not, or his plower, need<br />
In quest of iron seek the distant town,<span class="lnm">1035</span><br />
But hence he shall himself their wants supply.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_23-25">[25]</a><br />
<span class="pgnm">584</span><a name="page_584" id="page_584"></a>
Then Polyp&oelig;tes brave in fight arose,<br />
Arose Leonteus also, godlike chief,<br />
With Ajax son of Telamon. Each took<br />
His station, and Epe&uuml;s seized the clod.<span class="lnm">1040</span><br />
He swung, he cast it, and the Grecians laugh'd.<br />
Leonteus, branch of Mars, quoited it next.<br />
Huge Telamonian Ajax with strong arm<br />
Dismiss'd it third, and overpitch'd them both.<br />
But when brave Polyp&oelig;tes seized the mass<span class="lnm">1045</span><br />
Far as the vigorous herdsman flings his staff<br />
That twirling flies his numerous beeves between,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_23-26">[26]</a><br />
So far his cast outmeasured all beside,<br />
And the host shouted. Then the friends arose<br />
Of Polyp&oelig;tes valiant chief, and bore<span class="lnm">1050</span><br />
His ponderous acquisition to the ships.</p>
<p>  The archers' prize Achilles next proposed,<br />
Ten double and ten single axes, form'd<br />
Of steel convertible to arrow-points.<br />
He fix'd, far distant on the sands, the mast<span class="lnm">1055</span><br />
Of a brave bark cerulean-prow'd, to which<br />
With small cord fasten'd by the foot he tied<br />
A timorous dove, their mark at which to aim.<br />
<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_23-27">[27]</a>Who strikes the dove, he conquers, and shall bear<br />
These double axes all into his tent.<span class="lnm">1060</span><br />
But who the cord alone, missing the bird,<br />
Successful less, he wins the single blades.</p>
<p>  The might of royal Teucer then arose,<br />
And, fellow-warrior of the King of Crete,<br />
Valiant Meriones. A brazen casque<span class="lnm">1065</span><br />
Received the lots; they shook them, and the lot<br />
<span class="pgnm">585</span><a name="page_585" id="page_585"></a>
Fell first to Teucer. He, at once, a shaft<br />
Sent smartly forth, but vow'd not to the King<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_23-28">[28]</a><br />
A hecatomb, all firstlings of the flock.<br />
He therefore (for Apollo greater praise<span class="lnm">1070</span><br />
Denied him) miss'd the dove, but struck the cord<br />
That tied her, at small distance from the knot,<br />
And with his arrow sever'd it. Upsprang<br />
The bird into the air, and to the ground<br />
Depending fell the cord. Shouts rent the skies.<span class="lnm">1075</span><br />
Then, all in haste, Meriones the bow<br />
Caught from his hand holding a shaft the while<br />
Already aim'd, and to Apollo vow'd<br />
A hecatomb, all firstlings of the flock.<br />
He eyed the dove aloft, under a cloud,<span class="lnm">1080</span><br />
And, while she wheel'd around, struck her beneath<br />
The pinion; through her and beyond her pass'd<br />
The arrow, and, returning, pierced the soil<br />
Fast by the foot of brave Meriones.<br />
She, perching on the mast again, her head<span class="lnm">1085</span><br />
Reclined, and hung her wide-unfolded wing,<br />
But, soon expiring, dropp'd and fell remote.<br />
Amazement seized the people. To his tent<br />
Meriones the ten best axes bore,<br />
And Teucer the inferior ten to his.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_23-29">[29]</a><span class="lnm">1090</span></p>
<p>  Then, last, Achilles in the circus placed<br />
A ponderous spear and caldron yet unfired,<br />
Emboss'd with flowers around, its worth an ox.<br />
Upstood the spear-expert; Atrides first,<br />
Wide-ruling Agamemnon, King of men,<span class="lnm">1095</span><br />
And next, brave fellow-warrior of the King<br />
Of Crete, Meriones; when thus his speech<br />
Achilles to the royal chief address'd.</p>
<p>  Atrides! (for we know thy skill and force<br />
Matchless! that none can hurl the spear as thou)<span class="lnm">1100</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">586</span><a name="page_586" id="page_586"></a>
This prize is thine, order it to thy ship;<br />
And if it please thee, as I would it might,<br />
Let brave Meriones the spear receive.</p>
<p>  He said; nor Agamemnon not complied,<br />
But to Meriones the brazen spear<br />
Presenting, to Talthybius gave in charge<br />
The caldron, next, his own illustrious prize.</p>

ransom for the body of Hector. Hector is mourned, and the manner of
his funeral, circumstantially described, concludes the poem.</p>

<h3 class="chap">BOOK XXIV.</h3>

<div class="poem">
<p class="noind">The games all closed, the people went dispersed<br />
Each to his ship; they, mindful of repast,<br />
And to enjoy repose; but other thoughts<br />
Achilles' mind employ'd: he still deplored<br />
With tears his loved Patroclus, nor the force<span class="lnm">5</span><br />
Felt of all-conquering sleep, but turn'd and turn'd<br />
Restless from side to side, mourning the loss<br />
Of such a friend, so manly, and so brave.<br />
Their fellowship in toil; their hardships oft<br />
Sustain'd in fight laborious, or o'ercome<span class="lnm">10</span><br />
With difficulty on the perilous deep&mdash;<br />
Remembrance busily retracing themes<br />
Like these, drew down his cheeks continual tears.<br />
Now on his side he lay, now lay supine,<br />
Now prone, then starting from his couch he roam'd<span class="lnm">15</span><br />
Forlorn the beach, nor did the rising morn<br />
On seas and shores escape his watchful eye,<br />
But joining to his chariot his swift steeds,<br />
He fasten'd Hector to be dragg'd behind.<br />
Around the tomb of Men&oelig;tiades<span class="lnm">20</span><br />
Him thrice he dragg'd; then rested in his tent,<br />
Leaving him at his length stretch'd in the dust.<br />
Meantime Apollo with compassion touch'd<br />
Even of the lifeless Hector, from all taint<br />
Saved him, and with the golden &aelig;gis broad<span class="lnm">25</span><br />
Covering, preserved him, although dragg'd, untorn.</p>
<p><span class="pgnm">590</span><a name="page_590" id="page_590"></a>
  While he, indulging thus his wrath, disgraced<br />
Brave Hector, the immortals at that sight<br />
With pity moved, exhorted Mercury<br />
The watchful Argicide, to steal him thence.<span class="lnm">30</span><br />
That counsel pleased the rest, but neither pleased<br />
Juno, nor Neptune, nor the blue-eyed maid.<br />
They still, as at the first, held fast their hate<br />
Of sacred Troy, detested Priam still,<br />
And still his people, mindful of the crime<span class="lnm">35</span><br />
Of Paris, who when to his rural hut<br />
They came, those Goddesses affronting,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_24-1">[1]</a> praise<br />
And admiration gave to her alone<br />
Who with vile lusts his preference repaid.<br />
But when the twelfth ensuing morn arose,<span class="lnm">40</span><br />
Apollo, then, the immortals thus address'd.</p>
<p>  Ye Gods, your dealings now injurious seem<br />
And cruel. Was not Hector wont to burn<br />
Thighs of fat goats and bullocks at your shrines?<br />
Whom now, though dead, ye cannot yet endure<span class="lnm">45</span><br />
To rescue, that Andromache once more<br />
Might view him, his own mother, his own son,<br />
His father and the people, who would soon<br />
Yield him his just demand, a funeral fire.<br />
But, oh ye Gods! your pleasure is alone<span class="lnm">50</span><br />
To please Achilles, that pernicious chief,<br />
Who neither right regards, nor owns a mind<br />
That can relent, but as the lion, urged<br />
By his own dauntless heart and savage force,<br />
Invades without remorse the rights of man,<span class="lnm">55</span><br />
That he may banquet on his herds and flocks,<br />
So Peleus' son all pity from his breast<br />
Hath driven, and shame, man's blessing or his curse.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_24-2">[2]</a><br />
<span class="pgnm">591</span><a name="page_591" id="page_591"></a>
For whosoever hath a loss sustain'd<br />
Still dearer, whether of his brother born<span class="lnm">60</span><br />
From the same womb, or even of his son,<br />
When he hath once bewail'd him, weeps no more,<br />
For fate itself gives man a patient mind.<br />
Yet Peleus' son, not so contented, slays<br />
Illustrious Hector first, then drags his corse<span class="lnm">65</span><br />
In cruel triumph at his chariot-wheels<br />
Around Patroclus' tomb; but neither well<br />
He acts, nor honorably to himself,<br />
Who may, perchance, brave though he be, incur<br />
Our anger, while to gratify revenge<span class="lnm">70</span><br />
He pours dishonor thus on senseless clay.</p>
<p>  To whom, incensed, Juno white-arm'd replied.<br />
And be it so; stand fast this word of thine,<br />
God of the silver bow! if ye account<br />
Only such honor to Achilles due<span class="lnm">75</span><br />
As Hector claims; but Hector was by birth<br />
Mere man, and suckled at a woman's breast.<br />
Not such Achilles; him a Goddess bore,<br />
Whom I myself nourish'd, and on my lap<br />
Fondled, and in due time to Peleus gave<span class="lnm">80</span><br />
In marriage, to a chief beloved in heaven<br />
Peculiarly; ye were yourselves, ye Gods!<br />
Partakers of the nuptial feast, and thou<br />
Wast present also with thine harp in hand,<br />
Thou comrade of the vile! thou faithless ever!<span class="lnm">85</span></p>
<p>  Then answer thus cloud-gatherer Jove return'd.<br />
Juno, forbear. Indulge not always wrath<br />
Against the Gods. They shall not share alike,<br />
And in the same proportion our regards.<br />
Yet even Hector was the man in Troy<span class="lnm">90</span><br />
Most favor'd by the Gods, and him no less<br />
I also loved, for punctual were his gifts<br />
To us; mine altar never miss'd from him<br />
Libation, or the steam of sacrifice,<br />
The meed allotted to us from of old.<span class="lnm">95</span><br />
But steal him not, since by Achilles' eye<br />
<span class="pgnm">592</span><a name="page_592" id="page_592"></a>
Unseen ye cannot, who both day and night<br />
Watches<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_24-3">[3]</a> him, as a mother tends her son.<br />
But call ye Thetis hither, I would give<br />
The Goddess counsel, that, at Priam's hands<span class="lnm">100</span><br />
Accepting gifts, Achilles loose the dead.</p>
<p>  He ceased. Then Iris tempest-wing'd arose.<br />
Samos between, and Imbrus rock-begirt,<br />
She plunged into the gloomy flood; loud groan'd<br />
The briny pool, while sudden down she rush'd,<span class="lnm">105</span><br />
As sinks the bull's<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_24-4">[4]</a> horn with its leaden weight,<br />
Death bearing to the raveners of the deep.<br />
Within her vaulted cave Thetis she found<br />
By every nymph of Ocean round about<br />
Encompass'd; she, amid them all, the fate<span class="lnm">110</span><br />
Wept of her noble son ordain'd to death<br />
At fertile Troy, from Phthia far remote.<br />
Then, Iris, drawing near, her thus address'd.</p>
<p>  Arise, O Thetis! Jove, the author dread<br />
Of everlasting counsels, calls for thee.<span class="lnm">115</span></p>
<p>  To whom the Goddess of the silver feet.<br />
Why calls the mighty Thunderer me? I fear,<br />
Oppress'd with countless sorrows as I am,<br />
To mingle with the Gods. Yet I obey&mdash;<br />
No word of his can prove an empty sound.<span class="lnm">120</span></p>
<p>  So saying, the Goddess took her sable veil<br />
(Eye ne'er beheld a darker) and began<br />
Her progress, by the storm-wing'd Iris led.<br />
On either hand the billows open'd wide<br />
A pass before them; they, ascending soon<span class="lnm">125</span><br />
The shore, updarted swift into the skies.<br />
They found loud-voiced Saturnian Jove around<br />
Environ'd by the ever-blessed Gods<br />
Convened in full assembly; she beside<br />
<span class="pgnm">593</span><a name="page_593" id="page_593"></a>
Her Father Jove (Pallas retiring) sat.<span class="lnm">130</span><br />
Then, Juno, with consolatory speech,<br />
Presented to her hand a golden cup,<br />
Of which she drank, then gave it back again,<br />
And thus the sire of Gods and men began.</p>
<p>  Goddess of ocean, Thetis! thou hast sought<span class="lnm">135</span><br />
Olympus, bearing in thy bosom grief<br />
Never to be assuaged, as well I know.<br />
Yet shalt thou learn, afflicted as thou art,<br />
Why I have summon'd thee. Nine days the Gods,<br />
Concerning Hector's body and thy own<span class="lnm">140</span><br />
Brave city-spoiler son, have held dispute,<br />
And some have urged ofttimes the Argicide<br />
Keen-sighted Mercury, to steal the dead.<br />
But I forbade it for Achilles' sake,<br />
Whom I exalt, the better to insure<span class="lnm">145</span><br />
Thy reverence and thy friendship evermore.<br />
Haste, therefore, seek thy son, and tell him thus,<br />
The Gods resent it, say (but most of all<br />
Myself am angry) that he still detains<br />
Amid his fleet, through fury of revenge,<span class="lnm">150</span><br />
Unransom'd Hector; so shall he, at length,<br />
Through fear of me, perchance, release the slain.<br />
Myself to generous Priam will, the while,<br />
Send Iris, who shall bid him to the fleet<br />
Of Greece, such ransom bearing as may soothe<span class="lnm">155</span><br />
Achilles, for redemption of his son.</p>
<p>  So spake the God, nor Thetis not complied.<br />
Descending swift from the Olympian heights<br />
She reach'd Achilles' tent. Him there she found<br />
Groaning disconsolate, while others ran<span class="lnm">160</span><br />
To and fro, occupied around a sheep<br />
New-slaughter'd, large, and of exuberant fleece.<br />
She, sitting close beside him, softly strok'd<br />
His cheek, and thus, affectionate, began.</p>
<p>  How long, my son! sorrowing and mourning here,<span class="lnm">165</span><br />
Wilt thou consume thy soul, nor give one thought<br />
Either to food or love? Yet love is good,<br />
<span class="pgnm">594</span><a name="page_594" id="page_594"></a>
And woman grief's best cure; for length of days<br />
Is not thy doom, but, even now, thy death<br />
And ruthless destiny are on the wing.<span class="lnm">170</span><br />
Mark me,&mdash;I come a lieger sent from Jove.<br />
The Gods, he saith, resent it, but himself<br />
More deeply than the rest, that thou detain'st<br />
Amid thy fleet, through fury of revenge,<br />
Unransom'd Hector. Be advised, accept<span class="lnm">175</span><br />
Ransom, and to his friends resign the dead.</p>
<p>  To whom Achilles, swiftest of the swift.<br />
Come then the ransomer, and take him hence;<br />
If Jove himself command it,&mdash;be it so.</p>
<p>  So they, among the ships, conferring sat<span class="lnm">180</span><br />
On various themes, the Goddess and her son;<br />
Meantime Saturnian Jove commanded down<br />
His swift ambassadress to sacred Troy.</p>
<p>  Hence, rapid Iris! leave the Olympian heights.<br />
And, finding noble Priam, bid him haste<span class="lnm">185</span><br />
Into Achaia's fleet, bearing such gifts<br />
As may assuage Achilles, and prevail<br />
To liberate the body of his son.<br />
Alone, he must; no Trojan of them all<br />
May company the senior thither, save<span class="lnm">190</span><br />
An ancient herald to direct his mules<br />
And his wheel'd litter, and to bring the dead<br />
Back into Ilium, whom Achilles slew.<br />
Let neither fear of death nor other fear<br />
Trouble him aught, so safe a guard and sure<span class="lnm">195</span><br />
We give him; Mercury shall be his guide<br />
Into Achilles' presence in his tent.<br />
Nor will himself Achilles slay him there,<br />
Or even permit his death, but will forbid<br />
All violence; for he is not unwise<span class="lnm">200</span><br />
Nor heedless, no&mdash;nor wilful to offend,<br />
But will his suppliant with much grace receive.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_24-5">[5]</a></p>
<p><span class="pgnm">595</span><a name="page_595" id="page_595"></a>
  He ceased; then Iris tempest-wing'd arose,<br />
Jove's messenger, and, at the gates arrived<br />
Of Priam, wo and wailing found within.<span class="lnm">205</span><br />
Around their father, in the hall, his sons<br />
Their robes with tears water'd, while them amidst<br />
The hoary King sat mantled, muffled close,<br />
And on his venerable head and neck<br />
Much dust was spread, which, rolling on the earth,<span class="lnm">210</span><br />
He had shower'd on them with unsparing hands.<br />
The palace echoed to his daughters' cries,<br />
And to the cries of matrons calling fresh<br />
Into remembrance many a valiant chief<br />
Now stretch'd in dust, by Argive hands destroy'd.<span class="lnm">215</span><br />
The messenger of Jove at Priam's side<br />
Standing, with whisper'd accents low his ear<br />
Saluted, but he trembled at the sound.</p>
<p>  Courage, Dardanian Priam! fear thou nought;<br />
To thee no prophetess of ill, I come;<span class="lnm">220</span><br />
But with kind purpose: Jove's ambassadress<br />
Am I, who though remote, yet entertains<br />
Much pity, and much tender care for thee.<br />
Olympian Jove commands thee to redeem<br />
The noble Hector, with an offering large<span class="lnm">225</span><br />
Of gifts that may Achilles' wrath appease.<br />
Alone, thou must; no Trojan of them all<br />
Hath leave to attend thy journey thither, save<br />
An ancient herald to direct thy mules<br />
And thy wheel'd litter, and to bring the dead<span class="lnm">230</span><br />
Back into Ilium, whom Achilles slew.<br />
Let neither fear of death nor other fear<br />
Trouble thee aught, so safe a guard and sure<br />
He gives thee; Mercury shall be thy guide<br />
Even to Achilles' presence in his tent.<span class="lnm">235</span><br />
Nor will himself Achilles slay thee there,<br />
Or even permit thy death, but will forbid<br />
All violence; for he is not unwise<br />
Nor heedless, no&mdash;nor wilful to offend,<br />
But will his suppliant with much grace receive.<span class="lnm">240</span></p>
<p><span class="pgnm">596</span><a name="page_596" id="page_596"></a>
  So spake the swift ambassadress, and went.<br />
Then, calling to his sons, he bade them bring<br />
His litter forth, and bind the coffer on,<br />
While to his fragrant chamber he repair'd<br />
Himself, with cedar lined and lofty-roof'd,<span class="lnm">245</span><br />
A treasury of wonders into which<br />
The Queen he summon'd, whom he thus bespake.</p>
<p>  Hecuba! the ambassadress of Jove<br />
Hath come, who bids me to the Grecian fleet,<br />
Bearing such presents thither as may soothe<span class="lnm">250</span><br />
Achilles, for redemption of my son.<br />
But say, what seems this enterprise to thee?<br />
Myself am much inclined to it, I feel<br />
My courage prompting me amain toward<br />
The fleet, and into the Achaian camp.<span class="lnm">255</span></p>
<p>  Then wept the Queen aloud, and thus replied.<br />
Ah! whither is thy wisdom fled, for which<br />
Both strangers once, and Trojans honor'd <i>thee</i>?<br />
How canst thou wish to penetrate alone<br />
The Grecian fleet, and to appear before<span class="lnm">260</span><br />
His face, by whom so many valiant sons<br />
Of thine have fallen? Thou hast an iron heart!<br />
For should that savage man and faithless once<br />
Seize and discover thee, no pity expect<br />
Or reverence at his hands. Come&mdash;let us weep<span class="lnm">265</span><br />
Together, here sequester'd; for the thread<br />
Spun for him by his destiny severe<br />
When he was born, ordain'd our son remote<br />
From us his parents to be food for hounds<br />
In that chief's tent. Oh! clinging to his side,<span class="lnm">270</span><br />
How I could tear him with my teeth! His deeds,<br />
Disgraceful to my son, then should not want<br />
Retaliation; for he slew not him<br />
Skulking, but standing boldly for the wives,<br />
The daughters fair, and citizens of Troy,<span class="lnm">275</span><br />
Guiltless of flight,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_24-6">[6]</a> and of the wish to fly.</p>
<p><span class="pgnm">597</span><a name="page_597" id="page_597"></a>
  Whom godlike Priam answer'd, ancient King.<br />
Impede me not who willing am to go,<br />
Nor be, thyself, a bird of ominous note<br />
To terrify me under my own roof,<span class="lnm">280</span><br />
For thou shalt not prevail. Had mortal man<br />
Enjoin'd me this attempt, prophet, or priest,<br />
Or soothsayer, I had pronounced him false<br />
And fear'd it but the more. But, since I saw<br />
The Goddess with these eyes, and heard, myself,<span class="lnm">285</span><br />
The voice divine, I go; that word shall stand;<br />
And, if my doom be in the fleet of Greece<br />
To perish, be it so; Achilles' arm<br />
Shall give me speedy death, and I shall die<br />
Folding my son, and satisfied with tears.<span class="lnm">290</span></p>
<p>  So saying, he open'd wide the elegant lids<br />
Of numerous chests, whence mantles twelve he took<br />
Of texture beautiful; twelve single cloaks;<br />
As many carpets, with as many robes,<br />
To which he added vests, an equal store.<span class="lnm">295</span><br />
He also took ten talents forth of gold,<br />
All weigh'd, two splendid tripods, caldrons four,<br />
And after these a cup of matchless worth<br />
Given to him when ambassador in Thrace;<br />
A noble gift, which yet the hoary King<span class="lnm">300</span><br />
Spared not, such fervor of desire he felt<br />
To loose his son. Then from his portico,<br />
With angry taunts he drove the gather'd crowds.</p>
<p>  Away! away! ye dregs of earth, away!<br />
Ye shame of human kind! Have ye no griefs<span class="lnm">305</span><br />
At home, that ye come hither troubling <i>me</i>?<br />
Deem ye it little that Saturnian Jove<br />
Afflicts me thus, and of my very best,<br />
Best boy deprives me? Ah! ye shall be taught<br />
Yourselves that loss, far easier to be slain<span class="lnm">310</span><br />
By the Achaians now, since he is dead.<br />
But I, ere yet the city I behold<br />
Taken and pillaged, with these aged eyes,<br />
Shall find safe hiding in the shades below.</p>
<p><span class="pgnm">598</span><a name="page_598" id="page_598"></a>
  He said, and chased them with his staff; they left<span class="lnm">315</span><br />
In haste the doors, by the old King expell'd.<br />
Then, chiding them aloud, his sons he call'd,<br />
Helenus, Paris, noble Agathon,<br />
Pammon, Antiphonus, and bold in fight<br />
Polites, Dios of illustrious fame,<span class="lnm">320</span><br />
Hippotho&uuml;s and Deiphobus&mdash;all nine<br />
He call'd, thus issuing, angry, his commands.</p>
<p>  Quick! quick! ye slothful in your father's cause,<br />
Ye worthless brood! would that in Hector's stead<br />
Ye all had perish'd in the fleet of Greece!<span class="lnm">325</span><br />
Oh altogether wretched! in all Troy<br />
No man had sons to boast valiant as mine,<br />
And I have lost them all. Mestor is gone<br />
The godlike, Troilus the steed-renown'd,<br />
And Hector, who with other men compared<span class="lnm">330</span><br />
Seem'd a Divinity, whom none had deem'd<br />
From mortal man derived, but from a God.<br />
These Mars hath taken, and hath left me none<br />
But scandals of my house, void of all truth,<br />
Dancers, exact step-measurers,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_24-7">[7]</a> a band<span class="lnm">335</span><br />
Of public robbers, thieves of kids and lambs.<br />
Will ye not bring my litter to the gate<br />
This moment, and with all this package quick<br />
Charge it, that we may hence without delay?</p>
<p>  He said, and by his chiding awed, his sons<span class="lnm">340</span><br />
Drew forth the royal litter, neat, new-built,<br />
And following swift the draught, on which they bound<br />
The coffer; next, they lower'd from the wall<br />
The sculptured boxen yoke with its two rings;<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_24-8">[8]</a><br />
And with the yoke its furniture, in length<span class="lnm">345</span><br />
Nine cubits; this to the extremest end<br />
Adjusting of the pole, they cast the ring<br />
Over the ring-bolt; then, thrice through the yoke<br />
They drew the brace on both sides, made it fast<br />
<span class="pgnm">599</span><a name="page_599" id="page_599"></a>
With even knots, and tuck'd<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_24-9">[9]</a> the dangling ends.<span class="lnm">350</span><br />
Producing, next, the glorious ransom-price<br />
Of Hector's body, on the litter's floor<br />
They heap'd it all, then yoked the sturdy mules,<br />
A gift illustrious by the Mysians erst<br />
Conferr'd on Priam; to the chariot, last,<span class="lnm">355</span><br />
They led forth Priam's steeds, which the old King<br />
(In person serving them) with freshest corn<br />
Constant supplied; meantime, himself within<br />
The palace, and his herald, were employ'd<br />
Girding<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_24-10">[10]</a> themselves, to go; wise each and good.<span class="lnm">360</span><br />
And now came mournful Hecuba, with wine<br />
Delicious charged, which in a golden cup<br />
She brought, that not without libation due<br />
First made, they might depart. Before the steeds<br />
Her steps she stay'd, and Priam thus address'd.<span class="lnm">365</span></p>
<p>  Take this, and to the Sire of all perform<br />
Libation, praying him a safe return<br />
From hostile hands, since thou art urged to seek<br />
The Grecian camp, though not by my desire.<br />
Pray also to Id&aelig;an Jove cloud-girt,<span class="lnm">370</span><br />
Who oversees all Ilium, that he send<br />
His messenger or ere thou go, the bird<br />
His favorite most, surpassing all in strength,<br />
At thy right hand; him seeing, thou shalt tend<br />
With better hope toward the fleet of Greece.<span class="lnm">375</span><br />
But should loud-thundering Jove his lieger swift<br />
Withhold, from me far be it to advise<br />
This journey, howsoe'er thou wish to go.</p>
<p>  To whom the godlike Priam thus replied.<br />
<span class="pgnm">600</span><a name="page_600" id="page_600"></a>
This exhortation will I not refuse,<span class="lnm">380</span><br />
O Queen! for, lifting to the Gods his hands<br />
In prayer for their compassion, none can err.</p>
<p>  So saying, he bade the maiden o'er the rest,<br />
Chief in authority, pour on his hands<br />
Pure water, for the maiden at his side<span class="lnm">385</span><br />
With ewer charged and laver, stood prepared.<br />
He laved his hands; then, taking from the Queen<br />
The goblet, in his middle area stood<br />
Pouring libation with his eyes upturn'd<br />
Heaven-ward devout, and thus his prayer preferr'd.<span class="lnm">390</span></p>
<p>  Jove, great and glorious above all, who rulest,<br />
On Ida's summit seated, all below!<br />
Grant me arrived within Achilles' tent<br />
Kindness to meet and pity, and oh send<br />
Thy messenger or ere I go, the bird<span class="lnm">395</span><br />
Thy favorite most, surpassing all in strength,<br />
At my right hand, which seeing, I shall tend<br />
With better hope toward the fleet of Greece.</p>
<p>  He ended, at whose prayer, incontinent,<br />
Jove sent his eagle, surest of all signs,<span class="lnm">400</span><br />
The black-plumed bird voracious, Morphnos<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_24-11">[11]</a> named,<br />
And Percnos.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_24-11">[11]</a> Wide as the well-guarded door<br />
Of some rich potentate his vans he spread<br />
On either side; they saw him on the right,<br />
Skimming the towers of Troy; glad they beheld<span class="lnm">405</span><br />
That omen, and all felt their hearts consoled.</p>
<p>  Delay'd not then the hoary King, but quick<br />
Ascending to his seat, his coursers urged<br />
Through vestibule and sounding porch abroad.<br />
The four-wheel'd litter led, drawn by the mules<span class="lnm">410</span><br />
Which sage Id&aelig;us managed, behind whom<br />
Went Priam, plying with the scourge his steeds<br />
Continual through the town, while all his friends,<br />
Following their sovereign with dejected hearts,<br />
Lamented him as going to his death.<span class="lnm">415</span><br />
But when from Ilium's gate into the plain<br />
<span class="pgnm">601</span><a name="page_601" id="page_601"></a>
They had descended, then the sons-in-law<br />
Of Priam, and his sons, to Troy return'd.<br />
Nor they, now traversing the plain, the note<br />
Escaped of Jove the Thunderer; he beheld<span class="lnm">420</span><br />
Compassionate the venerable King,<br />
And thus his own son Mercury bespake.</p>
<p>  Mercury! (for above all others thou<br />
Delightest to associate with mankind<br />
Familiar, whom thou wilt winning with ease<span class="lnm">425</span><br />
To converse free) go thou, and so conduct<br />
Priam into the Grecian camp, that none<br />
Of all the numerous Dana&iuml; may see<br />
Or mark him, till he reach Achilles' tent.</p>
<p>  He spake, nor the ambassador of heaven<span class="lnm">430</span><br />
The Argicide delay'd, but bound in haste<br />
His undecaying sandals to his feet,<br />
Golden, divine, which waft him o'er the floods<br />
Swift as the wind, and o'er the boundless earth.<br />
He took his rod with which he charms to sleep<span class="lnm">435</span><br />
All eyes, and theirs who sleep opens again.<br />
Arm'd with that rod, forth flew the Argicide.<br />
At Ilium and the Hellespontic shores<br />
Arriving sudden, a king's son he seem'd,<br />
Now clothing first his ruddy cheek with down,<span class="lnm">440</span><br />
Which is youth's loveliest season; so disguised,<br />
His progress he began. They now (the tomb<br />
Magnificent of Ilus past) beside<br />
The river stay'd the mules and steeds to drink,<br />
For twilight dimm'd the fields. Id&aelig;us first<span class="lnm">445</span><br />
Perceived him near, and Priam thus bespake.</p>
<p>  Think, son of Dardanus! for we have need<br />
Of our best thought. I see a warrior. Now,<br />
Now we shall die; I know it. Turn we quick<br />
Our steeds to flight; or let us clasp his knees<span class="lnm">450</span><br />
And his compassion suppliant essay.</p>
<p>  Terror and consternation at that sound<br />
The mind of Priam felt; erect the hair<br />
Bristled his limbs, and with amaze he stood<br />
<span class="pgnm">602</span><a name="page_602" id="page_602"></a>
Motionless. But the God, meantime, approach'd,<span class="lnm">455</span><br />
And, seizing ancient Priam's hand, inquired.</p>
<p>  Whither, my father! in the dewy night<br />
Drivest thou thy mules and steeds, while others sleep?<br />
And fear'st thou not the fiery host of Greece,<br />
Thy foes implacable, so nigh at hand?<span class="lnm">460</span><br />
Of whom should any, through the shadow dun<br />
Of flitting night, discern thee bearing forth<br />
So rich a charge, then what wouldst thou expect?<br />
Thou art not young thyself, nor with the aid<br />
Of this thine ancient servant, strong enough<span class="lnm">465</span><br />
Force to repulse, should any threaten force.<br />
But injury fear none or harm from me;<br />
I rather much from harm by other hands<br />
Would save thee, thou resemblest so my sire.</p>
<p>  Whom answer'd godlike Priam, hoar with age.<span class="lnm">470</span><br />
My son! well spoken. Thou hast judged aright.<br />
Yet even me some Deity protects<br />
Thus far; to whom I owe it that I meet<br />
So seasonably one like thee, in form<br />
So admirable, and in mind discreet<span class="lnm">475</span><br />
As thou art beautiful. Blest parents, thine!</p>
<p>  To whom the messenger of heaven again,<br />
The Argicide. Oh ancient and revered!<br />
Thou hast well spoken all. Yet this declare,<br />
And with sincerity; bear'st thou away<span class="lnm">480</span><br />
Into some foreign country, for the sake<br />
Of safer custody, this precious charge?<br />
Or, urged by fear, forsake ye all alike<br />
Troy's sacred towers! since he whom thou hast lost,<br />
Thy noble son, was of excelling worth<span class="lnm">485</span><br />
In arms, and nought inferior to the Greeks.</p>
<p>  Then thus the godlike Priam, hoary King.<br />
But tell me first who <i>Thou</i> art, and from whom<br />
Descended, loveliest youth! who hast the fate<br />
So well of my unhappy son rehearsed?<span class="lnm">490</span></p>
<p>  To whom the herald Mercury replied.<br />
Thy questions, venerable sire! proposed<br />
<span class="pgnm">603</span><a name="page_603" id="page_603"></a>
Concerning noble Hector, are design'd<br />
To prove me. Him, not seldom, with these eyes<br />
In man-ennobling fight I have beheld<span class="lnm">495</span><br />
Most active; saw him when he thinn'd the Greeks<br />
With his sharp spear, and drove them to the ships.<br />
Amazed we stood to notice him; for us,<br />
Incensed against the ruler of our host,<br />
Achilles suffer'd not to share the fight.<span class="lnm">500</span><br />
I serve Achilles; the same gallant bark<br />
Brought us, and of the Myrmidons am I,<br />
Son of Polyctor; wealthy is my sire,<br />
And such in years as thou; six sons he hath,<br />
Beside myself the seventh, and (the lots cast<span class="lnm">505</span><br />
Among us all) mine sent me to the wars.<br />
That I have left the ships, seeking the plain,<br />
The cause is this; the Greeks, at break of day,<br />
Will compass, arm'd, the city, for they loathe<br />
To sit inactive, neither can the chiefs<span class="lnm">510</span><br />
Restrain the hot impatience of the host.</p>
<p>  Then godlike Priam answer thus return'd.<br />
If of the band thou be of Peleus' son,<br />
Achilles, tell me undisguised the truth.<br />
My son, subsists he still, or hath thy chief<span class="lnm">515</span><br />
Limb after limb given him to his dogs?</p>
<p>  Him answer'd then the herald of the skies.<br />
Oh venerable sir! him neither dogs<br />
Have eaten yet, nor fowls, but at the ships<br />
His body, and within Achilles' tent<span class="lnm">520</span><br />
Neglected lies. Twelve days he so hath lain;<br />
Yet neither worm which diets on the brave<br />
In battle fallen, hath eaten him, or taint<br />
Invaded. He around Patroclus' tomb<br />
Drags him indeed pitiless, oft as day<span class="lnm">525</span><br />
Reddens the east, yet safe from blemish still<br />
His corse remains. Thou wouldst, thyself, admire<br />
Seeing how fresh the dew-drops, as he lies,<br />
Rest on him, and his blood is cleansed away<br />
That not a stain is left. Even his wounds<span class="lnm">530</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">604</span><a name="page_604" id="page_604"></a>
(For many a wound they gave him) all are closed,<br />
Such care the blessed Gods have of thy son,<br />
Dead as he is, whom living much they loved.</p>
<p>  So he; then, glad, the ancient King replied.<br />
Good is it, oh my son! to yield the Gods<span class="lnm">535</span><br />
Their just demands. My boy, while yet he lived,<br />
Lived not unmindful of the worship due<br />
To the Olympian powers, who, therefore, him<br />
Remember, even in the bands of death.<br />
Come then&mdash;this beauteous cup take at my hand&mdash;<span class="lnm">540</span><br />
Be thou my guard, and, if the Gods permit,<br />
My guide, till to Achilles' tent I come.</p>
<p>  Whom answer'd then the messenger of heaven.<br />
Sir! thou perceivest me young, and art disposed<br />
To try my virtue; but it shall not fail.<span class="lnm">545</span><br />
Thou bidd'st me at thine hand a gift accept,<br />
Whereof Achilles knows not; but I fear<br />
Achilles, and on no account should dare<br />
Defraud him, lest some evil find me next.<br />
But thee I would with pleasure hence conduct<span class="lnm">550</span><br />
Even to glorious Argos, over sea<br />
Or over land, nor any, through contempt<br />
Of such a guard, should dare to do thee wrong.</p>
<p>  So Mercury, and to the chariot seat<br />
Upspringing, seized at once the lash and reins,<span class="lnm">555</span><br />
And with fresh vigor mules and steeds inspired.<br />
Arriving at the foss and towers, they found<br />
The guard preparing now their evening cheer,<br />
All whom the Argicide with sudden sleep<br />
Oppress'd, then oped the gates, thrust back the bars,<span class="lnm">560</span><br />
And introduced, with all his litter-load<br />
Of costly gifts, the venerable King.<br />
But when they reached the tent for Peleus' son<br />
Raised by the Myrmidons (with trunks of pine<br />
They built it, lopping smooth the boughs away,<span class="lnm">555</span><br />
Then spread with shaggy mowings of the mead<br />
Its lofty roof, and with a spacious court<br />
Surrounded it, all fenced with driven stakes;<br />
<span class="pgnm">605</span><a name="page_605" id="page_605"></a>
One bar alone of pine secured the door,<br />
Which ask'd three Grecians with united force<span class="lnm">570</span><br />
To thrust it to its place, and three again<br />
To thrust it back, although Achilles oft<br />
Would heave it to the door himself alone;)<br />
Then Hermes, benefactor of mankind,<br />
That bar displacing for the King of Troy,<span class="lnm">575</span><br />
Gave entrance to himself and to his gifts<br />
For Peleus' son design'd, and from the seat<br />
Alighting, thus his speech to Priam turn'd.</p>
<p>  Oh ancient Priam! an immortal God<br />
Attends thee; I am Hermes, by command<span class="lnm">580</span><br />
Of Jove my father thy appointed guide.<br />
But I return. I will not, entering here,<br />
Stand in Achilles' sight; immortal Powers<br />
May not so unreservedly indulge<br />
Creatures of mortal kind. But enter thou,<span class="lnm">585</span><br />
Embrace his knees, and by his father both<br />
And by his Goddess mother sue to him,<br />
And by his son, that his whole heart may melt.</p>
<p>  So Hermes spake, and to the skies again<br />
Ascended. Then leap'd Priam to the ground,<span class="lnm">590</span><br />
Leaving Id&aelig;us; he, the mules and steeds<br />
Watch'd, while the ancient King into the tent<br />
Proceeded of Achilles dear to Jove.<br />
Him there he found, and sitting found apart<br />
His fellow-warriors, of whom two alone<span class="lnm">595</span><br />
Served at his side, Alcimus, branch of Mars<br />
And brave Automedon; he had himself<br />
Supp'd newly, and the board stood unremoved.<br />
Unseen of all huge Priam enter'd, stood<br />
Near to Achilles, clasp'd his knees, and kiss'd<span class="lnm">600</span><br />
Those terrible and homicidal hands<br />
That had destroy'd so many of his sons.<br />
As when a fugitive for blood the house<br />
Of some chief enters in a foreign land,<br />
All gaze, astonish'd at the sudden guest,<span class="lnm">605</span><br />
So gazed Achilles seeing Priam there,<br />
<span class="pgnm">606</span><a name="page_606" id="page_606"></a>
And so stood all astonish'd, each his eyes<br />
In silence fastening on his fellow's face.<br />
But Priam kneel'd, and suppliant thus began.</p>
<p>  Think, oh Achilles, semblance of the Gods!<span class="lnm">610</span><br />
On thy own father full of days like me,<br />
And trembling on the gloomy verge of life.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_24-12">[12]</a><br />
Some neighbor chief, it may be, even now<br />
Oppresses him, and there is none at hand,<br />
No friend to suocor him in his distress.<span class="lnm">615</span><br />
Yet, doubtless, hearing that Achilles lives,<br />
He still rejoices, hoping, day by day,<br />
That one day he shall see the face again<br />
Of his own son from distant Troy return'd.<br />
But me no comfort cheers, whose bravest sons,<span class="lnm">620</span><br />
So late the flower of Ilium, all are slain.<br />
When Greece came hither, I had fifty sons;<br />
Nineteen were children of one bed, the rest<br />
Born of my concubines. A numerous house!<br />
But fiery Mars hath thinn'd it. One I had,<span class="lnm">625</span><br />
One, more than all my sons the strength of Troy,<br />
Whom standing for his country thou hast slain&mdash;<br />
Hector&mdash;his body to redeem I come<br />
Into Achaia's fleet, bringing, myself,<br />
Ransom inestimable to thy tent.<span class="lnm">630</span><br />
Reverence the Gods, Achilles! recollect<br />
Thy father; for his sake compassion show<br />
To me more pitiable still, who draw<br />
Home to my lips (humiliation yet<br />
Unseen on earth) his hand who slew my son.<span class="lnm">635</span></p>
<p>  So saying, he waken'd in his soul regret<br />
Of his own sire; softly he placed his hand<br />
On Priam's hand, and push'd him gently away.<br />
<span class="pgnm">607</span><a name="page_607" id="page_607"></a>
Remembrance melted both. Rolling before<br />
Achilles' feet, Priam his son deplored<span class="lnm">640</span><br />
Wide-slaughtering Hector, and Achilles wept<br />
By turns his father, and by turns his friend<br />
Patroclus; sounds of sorrow fill'd the tent.<br />
But when, at length satiate, Achilles felt<br />
His heart from grief, and all his frame relieved,<span class="lnm">645</span><br />
Upstarting from his seat, with pity moved<br />
Of Priam's silver locks and silver beard,<br />
He raised the ancient father by his hand,<br />
Whom in wing'd accents kind he thus bespake.</p>
<p>  Wretched indeed! ah what must thou have felt!<span class="lnm">650</span><br />
How hast thou dared to seek alone the fleet<br />
Of the Achaians, and his face by whom<br />
So many of thy valiant sons have fallen?<br />
Thou hast a heart of iron, terror-proof.<br />
Come&mdash;sit beside me&mdash;let us, if we may,<span class="lnm">665</span><br />
Great mourners both, bid sorrow sleep awhile.<br />
There is no profit of our sighs and tears;<br />
For thus, exempt from care themselves, the Gods<br />
Ordain man's miserable race to mourn.<br />
Fast by the threshold of Jove's courts are placed<span class="lnm">660</span><br />
Two casks, one stored with evil, one with good,<br />
From which the God dispenses as he wills.<br />
For whom the glorious Thunderer mingles both,<br />
He leads a life checker'd with good and ill<br />
Alternate; but to whom he gives unmixt<span class="lnm">665</span><br />
The bitter cup, he makes that man a curse,<br />
His name becomes a by-word of reproach,<br />
His strength is hunger-bitten, and he walks<br />
The blessed earth, unblest, go where he may.<br />
So was my father Peleus at his birth<span class="lnm">670</span><br />
Nobly endow'd with plenty and with wealth<br />
Distinguish'd by the Gods past all mankind,<br />
Lord of the Myrmidons, and, though a man,<br />
Yet match'd from heaven with an immortal bride.<br />
But even him the Gods afflict, a son<span class="lnm">675</span><br />
Refusing him, who might possess his throne<br />
<span class="pgnm">608</span><a name="page_608" id="page_608"></a>
Hereafter; for myself, his only heir,<br />
Pass as a dream, and while I live, instead<br />
Of solacing his age, here sit, before<br />
Your distant walls, the scourge of thee and thine.<span class="lnm">680</span><br />
Thee also, ancient Priam, we have heard<br />
Reported, once possessor of such wealth<br />
As neither Lesbos, seat of Macar, owns,<br />
Nor eastern Phrygia, nor yet all the ports<br />
Of Hellespont, but thou didst pass them all<span class="lnm">685</span><br />
In riches, and in number of thy sons.<br />
But since the Powers of heaven brought on thy land<br />
This fatal war, battle and deeds of death<br />
Always surround the city where thou reign'st.<br />
Cease, therefore, from unprofitable tears,<span class="lnm">690</span><br />
Which, ere they raise thy son to life again<br />
Shall, doubtless, find fresh cause for which to flow.</p>
<p>  To whom the ancient King godlike replied.<br />
Hero, forbear. No seat is here for me,<br />
While Hector lies unburied in your camp.<span class="lnm">695</span><br />
Loose him, and loose him now, that with these eyes<br />
I may behold my son; accept a price<br />
Magnificent, which may'st thou long enjoy,<br />
And, since my life was precious in thy sight,<br />
May'st thou revisit safe thy native shore!<span class="lnm">700</span></p>
<p>  To whom Achilles, lowering, and in wrath.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_24-13">[13]</a><br />
Urge me no longer, at a time like this,<br />
With that harsh note; I am already inclin'd<br />
To loose him. Thetis, my own mother came<br />
Herself on that same errand, sent from Jove.<span class="lnm">705</span><br />
Priam! I understand thee well. I know<br />
That, by some God conducted, thou hast reach'd<br />
Achaia's fleet; for, without aid divine,<br />
No mortal even in his prime of youth,<br />
Had dared the attempt; guards vigilant as ours<span class="lnm">710</span><br />
<span class="pgnm">609</span><a name="page_609" id="page_609"></a>
He should not easily elude, such gates,<br />
So massy, should not easily unbar.<br />
Thou, therefore, vex me not in my distress,<br />
Lest I abhor to see thee in my tent,<br />
And, borne beyond all limits, set at nought<span class="lnm">715</span><br />
Thee, and thy prayer, and the command of Jove.</p>
<p>  He said; the old King trembled, and obey'd.<br />
Then sprang Pelides like a lion forth,<br />
Not sole, but with his two attendant friends<br />
Alcimus and Automedon the brave,<span class="lnm">720</span><br />
For them (Patroclus slain) he honor'd most<br />
Of all the Myrmidons. They from the yoke<br />
Released both steeds and mules, then introduced<br />
And placed the herald of the hoary King.<br />
They lighten'd next the litter of its charge<span class="lnm">725</span><br />
Inestimable, leaving yet behind<br />
Two mantles and a vest, that, not unveil'd,<br />
The body might be borne back into Troy.<br />
Then, calling forth his women, them he bade<br />
Lave and anoint the body, but apart,<span class="lnm">730</span><br />
Lest haply Priam, noticing his son,<br />
Through stress of grief should give resentment scope,<br />
And irritate by some affront himself<br />
To slay him, in despite of Jove's commands.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_24-14">[14]</a><br />
They, therefore, laving and anointing first<span class="lnm">735</span><br />
The body, cover'd it with cloak and vest;<br />
Then, Peleus' son disposed it on the bier,<br />
Lifting it from the ground, and his two friends<br />
Together heaved it to the royal wain.<br />
Achilles, last, groaning, his friend invoked.<span class="lnm">740</span></p>
<p><span class="pgnm">610</span><a name="page_610" id="page_610"></a>
  Patroclus! should the tidings reach thine ear,<br />
Although in Ades, that I have released<br />
The noble Hector at his father's suit,<br />
Resent it not; no sordid gifts have paid<br />
His ransom-price, which thou shalt also share.<span class="lnm">745</span></p>
<p>  So saying, Achilles to his tent return'd,<br />
And on the splendid couch whence he had risen<br />
Again reclined, opposite to the seat<br />
Of Priam, whom the hero thus bespake.</p>
<p>  Priam! at thy request thy son is loosed,<span class="lnm">750</span><br />
And lying on his bier; at dawn of day<br />
Thou shalt both see him and convey him hence<br />
Thyself to Troy. But take we now repast;<br />
For even bright-hair'd Niobe her food<br />
Forgat not, though of children twelve bereft,<span class="lnm">755</span><br />
Of daughters six, and of six blooming sons.<br />
Apollo these struck from his silver bow,<br />
And those shaft-arm'd Diana, both incensed<br />
That oft Latona's children and her own<br />
Numbering, she scorn'd the Goddess who had borne<span class="lnm">760</span><br />
Two only, while herself had twelve to boast.<br />
Vain boast! those two sufficed to slay them all.<br />
Nine days they welter'd in their blood, no man<br />
Was found to bury them, for Jove had changed<br />
To stone the people; but themselves, at last,<span class="lnm">765</span><br />
The Powers of heaven entomb'd them on the tenth.<br />
Yet even she, once satisfied with tears,<br />
Remember'd food; and now the rocks among<br />
And pathless solitudes of Sipylus,<br />
The rumor'd cradle of the nymphs who dance<span class="lnm">770</span><br />
On Achelo&uuml;s' banks, although to stone<br />
Transform'd, she broods her heaven-inflicted woes.<br />
Come, then, my venerable guest! take we<br />
Refreshment also; once arrived in Troy<br />
With thy dear son, thou shalt have time to weep<span class="lnm">775</span><br />
Sufficient, nor without most weighty cause.</p>
<p>  So spake Achilles, and, upstarting, slew<br />
A sheep white-fleeced, which his attendants flay'd,<br />
<span class="pgnm">611</span><a name="page_611" id="page_611"></a>
And busily and with much skill their task<br />
Administ'ring, first scored the viands well,<span class="lnm">780</span><br />
Then pierced them with the spits, and when the roast<br />
Was finish'd, drew them from the spits again.<br />
And now, Automedon dispensed around<br />
The polish'd board bread in neat baskets piled,<br />
Which done, Achilles portion'd out to each<span class="lnm">785</span><br />
His share, and all assail'd the ready feast.<br />
But when nor hunger more nor thirst they felt,<br />
Dardanian Priam, wond'ring at his bulk<br />
And beauty (for he seem'd some God from heaven)<br />
Gazed on Achilles, while Achilles held<span class="lnm">790</span><br />
Not less in admiration of his looks<br />
Benign, and of his gentle converse wise,<br />
Gazed on Dardanian Priam, and, at length<br />
(The eyes of each gratified to the full)<br />
The ancient King thus to Achilles spake.<span class="lnm">795</span></p>
<p>  Hero! dismiss us now each to our bed,<br />
That there at ease reclined, we may enjoy<br />
Sweet sleep; for never have these eyelids closed<br />
Since Hector fell and died, but without cease<br />
I mourn, and nourishing unnumber'd woes,<span class="lnm">800</span><br />
Have roll'd me in the ashes of my courts.<br />
But I have now both tasted food, and given<br />
Wine to my lips, untasted till with thee.</p>
<p>  So he, and at his word Achilles bade<br />
His train beneath his portico prepare<span class="lnm">805</span><br />
With all dispatch two couches, purple rugs,<br />
And arras, and warm mantles over all.<br />
Forth went the women bearing lights, and spread<br />
A couch for each, when feigning needful fear,<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_24-15">[15]</a><br />
Achilles thus his speech to Priam turn'd.<span class="lnm">810</span></p>
<p>  My aged guest beloved; sleep thou without;<br />
<span class="pgnm">612</span><a name="page_612" id="page_612"></a>
Lest some Achaian chief (for such are wont<br />
Ofttimes, here sitting, to consult with me)<br />
Hither repair; of whom should any chance<br />
To spy thee through the gloom, he would at once<span class="lnm">815</span><br />
Convey the tale to Agamemnon's ear,<br />
Whence hindrance might arise, and the release<br />
Haply of Hector's body be delay'd.<br />
But answer me with truth. How many days<br />
Wouldst thou assign to the funereal rites<span class="lnm">820</span><br />
Of noble Hector, for so long I mean<br />
Myself to rest, and keep the host at home?</p>
<p>  Then thus the ancient King godlike replied.<br />
If thou indeed be willing that we give<br />
Burial to noble Hector, by an act<span class="lnm">825</span><br />
So generous, O Achilles! me thou shalt<br />
Much gratify; for we are shut, thou know'st,<br />
In Ilium close, and fuel must procure<br />
From Ida's side remote; fear, too, hath seized<br />
On all our people. Therefore thus I say.<span class="lnm">830</span><br />
Nine days we wish to mourn him in the house;<br />
To his interment we would give the tenth,<br />
And to the public banquet; the eleventh<br />
Shall see us build his tomb; and on the twelfth<br />
(If war we must) we will to war again.<span class="lnm">835</span></p>
<p>  To whom Achilles, matchless in the race.<br />
So be it, ancient Priam! I will curb<br />
Twelve days the rage of war, at thy desire.<a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_24-16">[16]</a></p>
<p>  He spake, and at his wrist the right hand grasp'd<br />
Of the old sovereign, to dispel his fear.<span class="lnm">840</span><br />
Then in the vestibule the herald slept<br />
And Priam, prudent both, but Peleus' son<br />
In the interior tent, and at his side<br />
Bris&euml;is, with transcendent beauty adorn'd.</p>
<p><span class="pgnm">613</span><a name="page_613" id="page_613"></a>
  Now all, all night, by gentle sleep subdued,<span class="lnm">845</span><br />
Both Gods and chariot-ruling warriors lay,<br />
But not the benefactor of mankind,<br />
Hermes; him sleep seized not, but deep he mused<br />
How likeliest from amid the Grecian fleet<br />
He might deliver by the guard unseen<span class="lnm">850</span><br />
The King of Ilium; at his head he stood<br />
In vision, and the senior thus bespake.</p>
<p>  Ah heedless and secure! hast thou no dread<br />
Of mischief, ancient King, that thus by foes<br />
Thou sleep'st surrounded, lull'd by the consent<span class="lnm">855</span><br />
And sufferance of Achilles? Thou hast given<br />
Much for redemption of thy darling son,<br />
But thrice that sum thy sons who still survive<br />

For <i>thy</i> redemption, should they know thee here.<span class="lnm">860</span></p>
<p>  He ended; at the sound alarm'd upsprang<br />
The King, and roused his herald. Hermes yoked<br />
Himself both mules and steeds, and through the camp<br />
Drove them incontinent, by all unseen.</p>
<p>  Soon as the windings of the stream they reach'd,<span class="lnm">865</span><br />
Deep-eddied Xanthus, progeny of Jove,<br />
Mercury the Olympian summit sought,<br />
And saffron-vested morn o'erspread the earth.<br />
They, loud lamenting, to the city drove<br />
Their steeds; the mules close follow'd with the dead.<span class="lnm">870</span><br />
Nor warrior yet, nor cinctured matron knew<br />
Of all in Ilium aught of their approach,<br />
Cassandra sole except. She, beautiful<br />
As golden Venus, mounted on the height<br />
Of Pergamus, her father first discern'd,<span class="lnm">875</span><br />
Borne on his chariot-seat erect, and knew:<br />
The herald heard so oft in echoing Troy;<br />
Him also on his bier outstretch'd she mark'd,<br />
Whom the mules drew. Then, shrieking, through the streets<br />
She ran of Troy, and loud proclaim'd the sight.<span class="lnm">880</span><br />
Ye sons of Ilium and ye daughters, haste,<br />
<span class="pgnm">614</span><a name="page_614" id="page_614"></a>
Haste all to look on Hector, if ye e'er<br />
With joy beheld him, while he yet survived,<br />
From fight returning; for all Ilium erst<br />
In him, and all her citizens rejoiced.<span class="lnm">885</span></p>
<p>  She spake. Then neither male nor female more<br />
In Troy remain'd, such sorrow seized on all.<br />
Issuing from the city-gate, they met<br />
Priam conducting, sad, the body home,<br />
And, foremost of them all, the mother flew<span class="lnm">890</span><br />
And wife of Hector to the bier, on which<br />
Their torn-off tresses with unsparing hands<br />
They shower'd, while all the people wept around.<br />
All day, and to the going down of day<br />
They thus had mourn'd the dead before the gates,<span class="lnm">895</span><br />
Had not their Sovereign from his chariot-seat<br />
Thus spoken to the multitude around.</p>
<p>  Fall back on either side, and let the mules<br />
Pass on; the body in my palace once<br />
Deposited, ye then may weep your fill.<span class="lnm">900</span></p>
<p>  He said; they, opening, gave the litter way.<br />
Arrived within the royal house, they stretch'd<br />
The breathless Hector on a sumptuous bed,<br />
And singers placed beside him, who should chant<br />
The strain funereal; they with many a groan<span class="lnm">905</span><br />
The dirge began, and still, at every close,<br />
The female train with many a groan replied.<br />
Then, in the midst, Andromache white-arm'd<br />
Between her palms the dreadful Hector's head<br />
Pressing, her lamentation thus began.<span class="lnm">910</span></p>
<p>  <a class="ftnt" href="#Bk_24-17">[17]</a>My hero! thou hast fallen in prime of life,<br />

<p>  So spake she weeping, whom her maidens all<br />

Mingled with sobs Hecuba next began.</p>

<li><p style="margin-top: 0;">"Latona's son and Jove's," was Apollo, the tutelary deity of the Dorians.
The Dorians had not, however, at this early age, become the predominant
race in Greece proper. They had spread along the eastern shores of
the Archipelago into the islands, especially Crete, and had every where signalized
themselves by the Temples of Apollo, of which there seems to have
been many in and about Troy. These temples were schools of art, and
prove the Dorians to have been both intellectual and powerful. Homer
was an Ionian, and therefore not deeply acquainted with the nature of the
Dorian god. But to a mind like his, the god of a people so cultivated, and
associated with what was most grand in art, must have been an imposing
being, and we find him so represented. Throughout the Iliad, he appears
and acts with splendor and effect, but always against the Greeks from mere
partiality to Hector. It would perhaps be too much to say, that in this
partiality to Hector, we detect the spirit of the Dorian worship, the only
Paganism of antiquity that tended to perfect the individual&mdash;Apollo being
the expression of the moral harmony of the universe, and the great spirit of
the Dorian culture being to make a perfect man, an incarnation of the
<span class="Greek" title="kosmos">
&kappa;&omicron;&sigma;&mu;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>.
This Homer could only have known intuitively.</p>

<p>In making Apollo author of the plague, he was confounded with Helios,
which was frequent afterwards, but is not seen elsewhere in Homer. The
arrows of Apollo were "silent as light," and their emblem the sun's rays.
The analogies are multitudinous between the natural and intellectual sun;
but Helios and Apollo were two.&mdash;E.P.P.</p></li>

<li><a name="Bk_1-2" id="Bk_1-2"></a><p>There is something exceedingly venerable in this appearance of the
priest. He comes with the ensigns of the gods to whom he belongs, with
the laurel wreath, to show that he was a suppliant, and a golden sceptre,
which the ancients gave in particular to Apollo, as they did one of silver to
Diana.</p></li>

<li><a name="Bk_1-3" id="Bk_1-3"></a><p>The art of this speech is remarkable. Chryses considers the army of
Greeks, as made up of troops, partly from the kingdoms and partly from
democracies, and therefore begins with a distinction that includes all.
Then, as priest of Apollo, he prays that they may obtain the two blessings
they most desire&mdash;the conquest of Troy and a safe return. As he names
his petition, he offers an extraordinary ransom, and concludes with bidding
them fear the god if they refuse it; like one who from his office seems to
foretell their misery, and exhorts them to shun it. Thus he endeavors to
work by the art of a general application, by religion, by interest, and the
insinuation of danger.</p></li>

<li><a name="Bk_1-4" id="Bk_1-4"></a><p>Homer is frequently eloquent in his silence. Chryses says not a word
in answer to the insults of Agamemnon, but walks pensively along the
shore. The melancholy flowing of the verse admirably expresses the condition
of the mournful and deserted father.</p></li>

<li><a name="Bk_1-6" id="Bk_1-6"></a><p>Apollo had temples at Chrysa, Tenedos, and Cilla, all of which lay
round the bay of Troas. M&uuml;ller remarks, that "the temple actually stood
in the situation referred to, and that the appellation of Smintheus was still
preserved in the district. Thus far actual circumstances are embodied in
the mythus. On the other hand, the action of the deity as such, is purely
ideal, and can have no other foundation than the belief that Apollo sternly
resents ill usage of his priests, and that too in the way here represented,
viz., by sending plagues. This belief is in perfect harmony with the idea
generally entertained of the power and agency of Apollo; and it is manifest
that the idea placed in combination with certain events, gave birth to the
story so far as relates to the god. We have not yet the means of ascertaining
whether it is to be regarded as a historical tradition, or an invention,
and must therefore leave that question for the present undecided."</p></li>

<li><a name="Bk_1-9" id="Bk_1-9"></a><p>The plague in the Grecian camp was occasioned perhaps by immoderate
heats and gross exhalations. Homer takes occasion from it, to open
the scene with a beautiful allegory. He supposes that such afflictions are
sent from Heaven for the punishment of evil actions; and because the sun
was the principal agent, he says it was sent to punish Agamemnon for
despising that god, and injuring his priest.</p></li>

<li><a name="Bk_1-10" id="Bk_1-10"></a><p>Hippocrates observes two things of plagues; that their cause is in the
air, and that different animals are differently affected by them, according to
their nature and nourishment. This philosophy is referred to the plagues
here mentioned. First, the cause is in the air by means of the darts or
beams of Apollo; second, the mules and dogs are said to die sooner than
the men, partly from their natural quickness of smell, and partly from their
feeding so near the earth whence the exhalations arise.</p></li>

<li><a name="Bk_1-11" id="Bk_1-11"></a><p>Juno, queen of Olympus, sides with the Grecians. Mr. Coleridge (in
his disquisition upon the Prometheus of &AElig;schylus, published in his Remains)
shows very clearly by historical criticism, that Juno, in the Grecian
religion, expressed the spirit of conservatism. Without going over his
argument we assume it here, for Homer always attributes to Juno every
thing that may be predicated of this principle. She is persistent, obstinate,
acts from no idea, but often uses a superficial reasoning, and refers to Fate,
with which she upbraids Jupiter. Jupiter is the intellectual power or Free
Will, and by their union, or rather from their antagonism, the course of
things proceeds with perpetual vicissitude, but with a great deal of life.&mdash;E.P.P.</p></li>

<li><a name="Bk_1-12" id="Bk_1-12"></a><p>Observe this Grecian priest. He has no political power, and commands
little reverence. In Agamemnon's treatment of him, as well as
Chryses, is seen the relation of the religion to the government. It was
neither master nor slave.&mdash;E.P.P.</p></li>

Phthiotis, according to Strabo, included all the southern portion of that
country as far as Mount &OElig;ta and the Maliac Gulf. To the west it bordered
on Dolopia, and on the east reached the confines of Magnesia. Homer
comprised within this extent of territory the districts of Phthia and Hellas
properly so called, and, generally speaking, the dominions of Achilles, together
with those of Protesilaus and Eurypylus.</p></li>

Agamemnon speaks of Chrys&euml;is as a beauty whom he values too much to
resign. Achilles treats Bris&euml;is as a slave, whom he is anxious to preserve
in point of honor, and as a testimony of his glory. Hence he mentions
her only as "his spoil," "the reward of war," etc.; accordingly he relinquishes
her not in grief for a favorite whom he loses, but in sullenness for
the injury done him.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dacier</span>.</p></li>

this fable of her descent is an allegory of Achilles restraining his wrath

of all, but allowed a liberty of speech which appears to us moderns

went upon those parties with a few only, and generally the most daring of
the army, and on occasions of the greatest hazard, when the exposure was
greater than in a regular battle. Idomeneus, in the 13th book, tells Meriones
that the greatest courage appears in this way of service, each man
being in a manner singled out to the proof of it.</p></li>

<li><a name="Bk_1-26" id="Bk_1-26"></a><p>The Iliad, in its connection, is, we all know, a glorification of Achilles
by Zeus; for the Trojans only prevail because Zeus wishes to show that
the reposing hero who sits in solitude, can alone conquer them. But to
leave him this glorification entirely unmixed with sorrow, the Grecian
sense of moderation forbids. The deepest anguish must mingle with his
consciousness of fame, and punish his insolence. That glorification is the
will of Zeus; and in the spirit of the ancient mythus, a motive for it is assigned
in a divine legend. The sea-goddess Thetis, who was, according to
the Phthiotic mythus, wedded to the mortal Peleus, saved Zeus, by calling
up the giant Briareus or &AElig;g&aelig;on to his rescue. Why it was &AElig;g&aelig;on, is
explained by the fact that this was a great sea-demon, who formed the subject
of fables at Poseidonian Corinth, where even the sea-god himself was
called &AElig;g&aelig;on; who, moreover, was worshipped at several places in Eub&oelig;a,
the seat of Poseidon &AElig;g&aelig;us; and whom the Theogony calls the son-in-law
of Poseidon, and most of the genealogists, especially Eumelus in the
Titanomachy, brought into relation with the sea. There is therefore good
reason to be found in ancient belief, why Thetis called up &AElig;g&aelig;on of all
others to Jove's assistance. The whole of the story, however, is not detailed&mdash;it
is not much more than indicated&mdash;and therefore it would be difficult
even now to interpret it in a perfectly satisfactory manner. It bears
the same relation to the Iliad, that the northern fables of the gods, which
serve as a back-ground to the legend of Nibelungen, bear to our German
ballad, only that here the separation is much greater still&mdash;<span class="smcap">Muller</span>.</p>

<p>Homer makes use of this fable, without reference to its meaning as an
allegory. Briareus seems to symbolize a navy, and the fable refers to some
event in remote history, when the reigning power was threatened in his
autocracy, and strengthened by means of his association with the people
against some intermediate class.&mdash;E.P.P.</p></li>

<li><a name="Bk_1-29" id="Bk_1-29"></a><p>Around the sources of the Nile, and thence south-west into the very
heart of Africa, stretching away indefinitely over its mountain plains, lies
the country which the ancients called Ethiopia, rumors of whose wonderful
people found their way early into Greece, and are scattered over the pages
of her poets and historians.</p>

<p>Homer wrote at least eight hundred years before Christ, and his poems
are well ascertained to be a most faithful mirror of the manners of his times
and the knowledge of his age.  *&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>Homer never wastes an epithet. He often alludes to the Ethiopians elsewhere,
and always in terms of admiration and praise, as being the most just
of men, and the favorites of the gods. The same allusions glimmer through
the Greek mythology, and appear in the verses of almost all the Greek poets,
ere yet the countries of Italy and Sicily were even discovered. The
Jewish Scriptures and Jewish literature abound in allusions to this distant
and mysterious people, the annals of the Egyptian priests are full of them,
and uniformly, the Ethiopians are there lauded as among the best, the most
religious, and most civilized of men.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Christian Examiner</span>.</p>

<p>The Ethiopians, says Diodorus, are said to be the inventors of pomps,
sacrifices, solemn meetings, and other honors paid to the gods. From
hence arose their character of piety, which is here celebrated by Homer.
Among these there was an annual feast at Diospolis, which Eustathius mentions,
when they carried about the statues of Jupiter and other gods, for
twelve days, according to their number; to which, if we add the ancient
custom of setting meat before statues, it will appear to be a rite from which
this fable might easily have arisen.</p></li>

thrown upon the victim; fourth, the manner of killing it, with the head
turned upwards; fifth, selecting the thighs and fat for their gods, as the
best of the sacrifice, and disposing about them pieces cut from every part

<li><a name="Bk_2-8" id="Bk_2-8"></a><p>The power of Agamemnon as a monarch refers to his being the leader

only the power of a magistrate, except as he held the office of priest. Aristotle
defines a king as a Leader of war, a Judge of controversies, and President
of the ceremonies of the gods. That he had the principal care of religious
rites, appears from many passages in Homer. His power was nowhere
absolute but in war, for we find Agamemnon insulted in the council,
but in the army threatening deserters with death. Agamemnon is sometimes
styled king of kings, as the other princes had given him supreme
authority over them in the siege.</p></li>

<li><a name="Bk_2-21" id="Bk_2-21"></a><p>However fabulous the other parts of Homer's poems may be, this account
of the princes, people, and countries, is by far the most valuable piece
of history and geography left us in regard to the state of Greece in that early
period. Greece was then divided into several dynasties, which Homer has
enumerated under their respective princes; and his division was considered
so correct, that many disputes respecting the boundaries of Grecian cities
were decided upon his authority. Eustathius has collected together the following
instances: The city of Calydon was adjudged to the &AElig;tolians, notwithstanding
the pretensions of &AElig;olia, because it was ranked by Homer as
belonging to the former. Sestos was given to those of Abydos, upon the
plea that he had said the Abydonians were possessors of Sestos, Abydos,
and Arisbe. When the Milesians and people of Priene disputed their claim
to Mycale, a verse of Homer gave it to the Milesians. The Athenians were
put in possession of Salamis by another which was cited by Solon, or (according
to some) interpolated by him for that purpose; and Porphyry says,
that the catalogue was so highly esteemed, that the youths of some nations
were required to commit it to memory.</p>

<p>Professor Felton remarks, "The student is advised to give particular
attention to this important passage. He will find it the most interesting
fragment of geography extant; interesting for the poetical beauty of the
verse, the regular order which is followed, and the little characteristic touches
which denote the peculiarities of the several provinces. The more he examines
this catalogue with the subsidiary lights of geography, history and
travels, the more cause will he find of wonder, that a description so ancient
should combine so much accuracy, beauty, and interest. It is recommended
to the student, to trace the provinces and cities on some good
map of ancient Greece."</p></li>

chieftains is obvious, and the sketches themselves are living and characteristic
to a high degree. The reminiscences of the aged Priam, as their

horn cut in thin pieces and fastened upon linen cloth, one piece overlapping
another. The sword hung on the left side by means of a belt which passed
over the right shoulder. The large round shield, sometimes made of osiers
twisted together and covered with several ox-hides, and bound round the
edge with metal. In the Homeric times it was supported by a belt; subsequently
a band was placed across the inner side, in which the left arm was
inserted, and a strong leather strap fastened near the edge at certain distances,
which was grasped by the hand. The helmet, made of metal and
lined with felt. Lastly the spear, and in many cases two. The heavy-armed

that a person standing in a chariot is killed (and sometimes by a stroke on
the head) by a foot soldier with a sword. This may farther appear from the
ease with which they mount or alight, to facilitate which, the chariots were
made open behind. That the wheels were small, may be supposed from
their custom of taking them off and putting them on. Hebe puts on the
wheels of Juno's chariot, when he called for it in battle. It may be in allusion
to the same custom, that it is said in Ex., ch. xiv.: "The Lord took
off their chariot wheels, so that they drove them heavily." That it was very
small and light, is evident from a passage in the tenth Il., where Diomede
debates whether he shall draw the chariot of Rhesus out of the way, or carry

The Old Testament furnishes examples. God opens the eyes of Hagar, that
she may see the fountain. "The Lord opened the eyes of Baalam, and he
saw the angel," etc. This power of sight was given to Diomede only for
the present occasion. In the 6th Book, on meeting Glaucus, he is ignorant

from the earliest times of which we have any record down to the

by the Christians during the middle ages. Its origin seems to have been
the same as that of sacrifices: viz. the belief that the gods were susceptible

The question is a difficult one, and the most distinguished scholars are

general excellence of the Iliad, could be composed without the aid of writing;
and yet, we are told, there are well-authenticated examples of such
works being preserved and handed down by traditional memory. However
this may be, we know that the Oriental nations were in possession of the

<li><a name="Bk_9-7" id="Bk_9-7"></a><p> Achilles having retired from action in displeasure to Agamemnon, quieted
himself by singing to his lyre the achievements of demi-gods and heroes.
Nothing was better suited to the martial disposition of this hero, than
these heroic songs. Celebrating the actions of the valiant prepared him for
his own great exploits. Such was the music of the ancients, and to such
purposes was it applied. When the lyre of Paris was offered to Alexander,
he replied that he had little value for it, but much desired that of Achilles,
on which he sung the actions of heroes in former times.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Plutarch</span>.</p></li>

<li><a name="Bk_9-8" id="Bk_9-8"></a><p>The manners of the Iliad are the manners of the patriarchal and early
ages of the East. The chief differences arise from a different religion and a
more maritime situation. Very far removed from the savage state on the
one hand, and equally distant from the artificial state of an extended commerce
and a manufacturing population on the other, the spirit and habitudes
of the two modes of society are almost identical. The hero and the Patriarch
are substantially co&euml;val; but the first wanders in twilight, the last stands
in the eye of Heaven. When three men appeared to Abraham in the plains
of Mamre, he ran to meet them from the tent door, brought them in, directed
Sarah to make bread, fetched from the herd himself a calf tender and
good, dressed it, and set it before them. When Ajax, Ulysses, and Ph&oelig;nix
stand before Achilles, he rushes forth to greet them, brings them into the
tent, directs Patroclus to mix the wine, cuts up the meat, dresses it, and
sets it before the ambassadors.&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>Instances of this sort might be multiplied to any extent, but the student
will find it a pleasing and useful task to discover them for himself; and these
will amply suffice to demonstrate the existence of that correspondence of
spirit and manners between the Homeric and the early ages of the Bible
history, to which I have adverted. It is real and important; it affords a
standard of the feelings with which we ought to read the Iliad, if we mean
to read it as it deserves; and it explains and sets in the true point of view
numberless passages, which the ignorance or frivolity of after-times has
charged with obscurity, meanness or error. The Old Testament and the Iliad
reflect light mutually on each other; and both in respect of poetry and morals
(for the whole of Homer's poetry is a praise of virtue, and every thing in
him tends to this point, except that which is merely superfluous and for
ornament) it may with great truth be said, that he who has the longest studied,
and the most deeply imbibed, the spirit of the Hebrew Bible, will the
best understand and the most lastingly appreciate the tale of Troy divine.&mdash;<span class="smcap">H.N. Coleridge</span>.</p></li>

Diomede, who was most renowned for valor, might have given a wrong interpretation

hand, it might imply that, as they discovered the bird by the noise of its

a small gift, but honorable and certain; the other a great one, but uncertain
and less honorable, because it is given as a reward. Diomede and

They proceed with caution and bravery; he with rashness and vanity.

<li><a name="Bk_11-18" id="Bk_11-18"></a><p>The address of Homer in bringing off Ajax is admirable. He makes
Hector afraid to approach him, and brings down Jupiter to terrify him.
Thus he retreats, not from a mortal, but from a God.</p>

<p>The whole passage is inimitably just and beautiful. We see Ajax slowly
retreating between two armies, and even with a look repulse the one and
protect the other. Every line resembles Ajax. The character of a stubborn
and undaunted warrior is perfectly maintained. He compares him first to
the lion for his undaunted spirit in fighting, and then to the ass for his stubborn
slowness in retreating. In the latter comparison there are many points
of resemblance that enliven the image. The havoc he makes in the field is
represented by the tearing and trampling down the harvests; and we see the
bulk, strength, and obstinancy of the hero, when the Trojans, in respect to
him, are compared to the troops of boys that impotently endeavor to drive
him away.</p>

a beast upon which kings and princes might ride with dignity.</p></li>

<li><a name="Bk_11-19" id="Bk_11-19"></a><p>Though the resentment of Achilles would not permit him to be an actor
in the field, yet his love of war inclines him to be a spectator. As the poet
did not intend to draw the character of a perfect man in Achilles, he makes
him delighted with the destruction of the Greeks, because it gratified his
revenge. That resentment which is the subject of the poem, still presides
over every other feeling, even the love of his country. He begins now to
pity his countrymen, yet he seems gratified by their distress, because it
will contribute to his glory.</p></li>

those here described. In particular, see &AElig;schylus in the Seven against Thebes.

having cleansed the body of Hector and covered it, he places it himself in
the litter, lest his father, seeing how indecently he had treated it, should be
exasperated at the sight, and by some passionate reproach exasperate himself
also. For that a person so singularly irascible and of a temper harsh as
his, should not only be aware of his infirmity, but even guard against it with
so much precaution, evidences a prudence truly wonderful.&mdash;Plutarch.]&mdash;<span class="smcap">Tr</span>.</p></li>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with

opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
